	abstract = {Levallois cores and products were manufactured by hominin populations distributed across wide regions of Africa and Eurasia. Levallois technology remains an important focus for research in Palaeolithic archaeology, yet quantitative morphological comparisons of Levallois core morphology from different regions remain rare. Here, utilizing Levallois cores from Africa, the Near East, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent, patterns of morphological variability in the shape of the Levallois flaking surface and core outline (margin) shape were examined for patterns of variability and stability across regions using 3D geometric morphometrics. The multivariate statistical shape analyses undertaken revealed a clear pattern: that is, the greatest levels of shape variability in Levallois cores is evident in the form of their outline (planform) shape. Conversely, the geometrical relationship between the margin of the Levallois cores and their topological surface morphology was relatively uniform. This pattern of variability was evident in terms of variation both across regions and between cores from the same locality. These results indicate that the outline form of such cores was a less important variable than the geometric/topological properties of the surface morphology and, in particular, the relationship between the margin of the core and those variables. These results have implications for why it has been reported that replicating such cores in modern experiments is a particularly difficult task. The specific interrelationship between the geometric properties of the core and the core margin provide further evidence that Levallois core technology would be unlikely to emerge from the context of opportunistic migrating platform reduction strategies (such as those seen in many Mode 1 industries). If, as is widely suggested, Levallois cores were deliberate products in Pleistocene contexts, these results also hint that relatively sophisticated means of social transmission (i.e. teaching) may have been required to sustain their production over time and space.},

	abstract = {Ethnographic research highlights that there are constraints placed on the time available to produce cultural artefacts in differing circumstances. Given that copying error, or cultural ‘mutation’, can have important implications for the evolutionary processes involved in material culture change, it is essential to explore empirically how such ‘time constraints’ affect patterns of artefactual variation. Here, we report an experiment that systematically tests whether, and how, varying time constraints affect shape copying error rates. A total of 90 participants copied the shape of a 3D ‘target handaxe form’ using a standardized foam block and a plastic knife. Three distinct ‘time conditions’ were examined, whereupon participants had either 20, 15, or 10 minutes to complete the task. One aim of this study was to determine whether reducing production time produced a proportional increase in copy error rates across all conditions, or whether the concept of a task specific ‘threshold’ might be a more appropriate manner to model the effect of time budgets on copy-error rates. We found that mean levels of shape copying error increased when production time was reduced. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the 20 minute and 15 minute conditions. Significant differences were only obtained between conditions when production time was reduced to 10 minutes. Hence, our results more strongly support the hypothesis that the effects of time constraints on copying error are best modelled according to a ‘threshold’ effect, below which mutation rates increase more markedly. Our results also suggest that ‘time budgets’ available in the past will have generated varying patterns of shape variation, potentially affecting spatial and temporal trends seen in the archaeological record. Hence, ‘time-budgeting’ factors need to be given greater consideration in evolutionary models of material culture change.},

	abstract = {The identification of early social complexity and differentiation in early village societies has been approached in the past most notably through the evaluation of rituals and architectural layouts. Such studies could be complemented by an approach that provides data about everyday behaviours of individuals. We took 540 human and animal bone samples for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis from the Neolithic site of Çayönü Tepesi in southeastern Anatolia. The inhabitants at this site chose to bury their dead in two different ways at different times during its occupation: beneath the floors of their houses, but also inside a public mortuary building known as the Skull Building. This variation provides an opportunity using isotope methods to test whether there was evidence for structuring of daily activities (diet in this case) that might serve to reinforce this change in burial practice. We show that when the inhabitants of Çayönü Tepesi changed their architecture and operated different burial practices in conjunction, this coincided with other aspects of behaviour including socially-constituted food consumption practices, which served to reinforce social identities.},

The main impact of university study was to increase students' awareness of the scope of archaeology, its contemporary relevance, the contingency of archaeological knowledge and the complexity of method and practice. Results are compared with other data about public attitudes to archaeology. The study suggests that potential students, like other members of the public, are attracted to aspects of archaeology which don't reflect realities of professional practice. Stressing archaeology's contemporary relevance and skills training for employability seems unlikely to attract more students. Ways to increase public interest in Australian archaeology include actively embracing archaeology's links with history and palaeontology, more focus on narratives of discovery in public education, and increasing the scope of archaeology taught in schools and shown on television.},

Such coincidences are often poorly dated or undated due to their antiquity or stratigraphic context. Cuddie Springs contains several distinct concentrations of megafaunal bone, in addition to a scatter of bone through all the sediments examined. Most of the deposit is beyond radiocarbon dating but an upper portion of sediment has been dated between 19,000 and 30,000 B.P. Artefacts and increased charcoal appear about 30,000 B.P. and then have a continuous presence. The artefact assemblage includes grindstones with starch residues, ochre, a probable cylcon and stone artefacts with reworked edges containing blood and hair. These combine to provide evidence of plant and animal processing and cultural practices at 30,000 B.P. The bones and artefacts were deposited when Cuddie Springs was a shallow freshwater lake surrounded by a relatively arid shrubland, the lake then became ephemeral and the environment more arid as the glacial maximum approached.},

In the global context, the losses on continental Africa have received little attention and are poorly understood. This study aims to inspire new discussion of African extinctions through a review of the extinct species and the chronology and possible causes of those extinctions. There are at least 24 large mammal (\&gt; 5 kg) species known to have disappeared from continental Africa during the late Pleistocene or Holocene, indicating a much greater taxonomic breadth than previously recognized. Among the better sampled taxa, these losses are restricted to the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, between 13,000 and 6000 yrs ago. The African extinctions preferentially affected species that are grazers or prefer grasslands. Where good terrestrial paleoenvironmental records are present, extinctions are associated with changes in the availability, productivity, or structure of grassland habitats, suggesting that environmental changes played a decisive role in the losses. In the broader evolutionary context, these extinctions represent recent examples of selective taxonomic winnowing characterized by the loss of grassland specialists and the establishment of large mammal communities composed of more ecologically flexible taxa over the last million years. There is little reason to believe that humans played an important role in African extinctions.},

The dramatic contraction in mammoth range ca. 12 kyr (uncalibrated 14C chronology), after which known populations were confined to Northern Siberia (mainly Taymyr and Wrangel Island), correlates well with the extensive spread of trees in the Allerød phase of the Late Glacial Interstadial. The return of open steppe-tundra in the Younger Dryas cold phase, ca. 10.6–10 kyr, saw a limited re-expansion into NE Europe, followed by retraction and apparent extinction of mainland populations, which can be correlated with the marked loss of open habitats in the early Holocene. In contrast, at the end of the Last Interglacial, the retreat of P. antiquus to S. Europe, where it may have survived to ca. 50–34 kyr, can be linked to the loss of woodland habitats elsewhere. Although in both species, climate acting through vegetational changes evidently drove these range shifts, environmental change alone appears insufficient to account for extinctions. However, the possible role of human hunters is also still unclear.},

	abstract = {Many large animal species have a high risk of extinction. This is usually thought to result simply from the way that species traits associated with vulnerability, such as low reproductive rates, scale with body size. In a broad-scale analysis of extinction risk in mammals, we find two additional patterns in the size selectivity of extinction risk. First, impacts of both intrinsic and environmental factors increase sharply above a threshold body mass around 3 kilograms. Second, whereas extinction risk in smaller species is driven by environmental factors, in larger species it is driven by a combination of environmental factors and intrinsic traits. Thus, the disadvantages of large size are greater than generally recognized, and future loss of large mammal biodiversity could be far more rapid than expected.
Large mammals weighing more than 3 kilograms are more likely than smaller species to go extinct in response to human-induced environmental changes.

We show that the blesbok-like fossils from Lainyamok belong to an extinct species, described here as Damaliscus hypsodon sp. nov. The D. hypsodon hypodigm includes the previously unnamed small alcelaphine material known from late Pleistocene sites elsewhere in Kenya and Tanzania. Its dental anatomy, together with an ecomorphological analysis of its postcrania, indicates that D. hypsodon grazed in open and arid grassland environments. Although Lainyamok is no longer represented entirely by extant species, the absence of species common earlier in the middle Pleistocene of East Africa suggests substantial faunal turnover between 500 and 400 ka. Damaliscus hypsodon persisted in East Africa until the end of the Pleistocene and its extinction can be attributed to a loss of arid grassland environments at the onset of the Holocene. The fossil evidence from southern Kenya suggests that the development of the taxonomically modern large mammal community was a long-term process characterized by the extinction of grazing specialists, with marked turnover occurring between {\textasciitilde} 500 and 400 ka and near the end of the Pleistocene.},

Of these sites, 12 involved mammoth (Mammuthus), the remaining two mastodon (Mammut). Here, we update that assessment. We examine Clovis-era, and earlier, sites reported since 2002, as well as sites examined previously but for which additional information has become available. Our assessment leads us to exclude Hebior (Wisconsin) from the list of accepted sites, and to add El Fin del Mundo (Sonora) and Wally's Beach (Alberta). There are now 15 sites on our list, providing what we find to be compelling evidence for human involvement in the death and/or dismemberment of five genera of now-extinct late Pleistocene mammals: Equus, Camelops, Cuvieronius, Mammut, and Mammuthus. As in 2002, however, we note this is a small fraction of the 37 genera that disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene, and for this and other reasons we remain highly skeptical that human overkill was responsible for their extinction.},

An accurate knowledge of the geography and chronology of these extinctions is crucial for testing these hypotheses. Previous assumptions that the megafauna of northern Eurasia had disappeared by the Pleistocene/Holocene transition were first challenged a decade ago by the discovery that the latest woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island, northeastern Siberia, were contemporaneous with ancient Egyptian civilization. Here we show that another spectacular megafaunal species, the giant deer or ‘Irish elk’, survived to around 6,900 radiocarbon yr bp (about 7,700 yr ago) in western Siberia—more than three millennia later than its previously accepted terminal date—and therefore, that the reasons for its ultimate demise are to be sought in Holocene not Pleistocene events. Before their extinction, both giant deer and woolly mammoth underwent dramatic shifts in distribution, driven largely by climatic/vegetational changes. Their differing responses reflect major differences in ecology.},

	abstract = {The Americas were the last continents to be populated by humans, and their colonization represents a very interesting chapter in our species' evolution in which important issues are still contentious or largely unknown. One difficult topic concerns the details of the early peopling of Beringia, such as for how long it was colonized before people moved into the Americas and the demography of this occupation. A recent work using mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) data presented evidence for a so called “three-stage model” consisting of a very early expansion into Beringia followed by ∼20,000 years of population stability before the final entry into the Americas. However, these results are in disagreement with other recent studies using similar data and methods. Here, we reanalyze their data to check the robustness of this model and test the ability of Native American mtDNA to discriminate details of the early colonization of Beringia. We apply the Bayesian Skyline Plot approach to recover the past demographic dynamic underpinning these events using different mtDNA data sets. Our results refute the specific details of the “three-stage model”, since the early stage of expansion into Beringia followed by a long period of stasis could not be reproduced in any mtDNA data set cleaned from non-Native American haplotypes. Nevertheless, they are consistent with a moderate population bottleneck in Beringia associated with the Last Glacial Maximum followed by a strong population growth around 18,000 years ago as suggested by other recent studies. We suggest that this bottleneck erased the signals of ancient demographic history from recent Native American mtDNA pool, and conclude that the proposed early expansion and occupation of Beringia is an artifact caused by the misincorporation of non-Native American haplotypes.},

We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data sets and show that it correctly reconstructs demographic history under canonical scenarios. Finally, we compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon years ago, which coincides with both the earliest undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the beginning of the Holocene.},

Specifically, we analyze mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data by using complementary coalescent models of demographic history and incorporating non-genetic data to enhance the anthropological relevance of the analysis.    Methodology/Findings  Bayesian skyline plots, which provide dynamic representations of population size changes over time, indicate that Amerinds went through two stages of growth ≈40,000 and ≈15,000 years ago separated by a long period of population stability. Isolation-with-migration coalescent analyses, which utilize data from sister populations to estimate a divergence date and founder population sizes, suggest an Amerind population expansion starting ≈15,000 years ago.    Conclusions/Significance  These results support a model for the peopling of the New World in which Amerind ancestors diverged from the Asian gene pool prior to 40,000 years ago and experienced a gradual population expansion as they moved into Beringia. After a long period of little change in population size in greater Beringia, Amerinds rapidly expanded into the Americas ≈15,000 years ago either through an interior ice-free corridor or along the coast. This rapid colonization of the New World was achieved by a founder group with an effective population size of ≈1,000–5,400 individuals. Our model presents a detailed scenario for the timing and scale of the initial migration to the Americas, substantially refines the estimate of New World founders, and provides a unified theory for testing with future datasets and analytic methods.},

	abstract = {The last two decades have seen numerous debates in the field of the initial settlement of America and noteworthy was the disagreement between physical and molecular anthropologists. Recently, it has been pointed out that this discordance could partly originate from the description methods and classification labels used in craniometry, which did not account fairly for the within-sample and within-group variance. From there, a federative model for the initial peopling of America has been designed which could now explain the biological variability found at both the craniofacial and genetic level. This is a major step in the study of the initial settlement of America, which deserved to be highlighted. The present paper recalls the two conflicting models that prevailed for the last 20 years of anthropological studies in America before browsing the newly accepted hypothesis about the origin of the first Amerindians as seen by its authors. Lastly, the article evokes some areas of investigations, which could furnish significant fallouts about the dynamics of the peopling of Americas in the future.},

One element common to many models of colonization (in North America and elsewhere) is that colonizers on a landscape with few other people not only had to be able to track great distances to find mates and exchange information and resources, they also had to be able to get along with near and distantly related groups they encountered. The conventional view of fast-moving, big-game hunters exploding on to the continent as the ice-free corridor zipped opened in terminal Pleistocene times is no longer a tenable scenario for the initial peopling of North America. Yet, though it is now believed that the peopling process was far more complex––beginning much earlier, possibly involving multiple migratory pulses and involving a different entry route––fundamental questions about the antiquity, number, timing, and adaptive strategies of the Pleistocene peoples of North America remain.},

Advocates of a pre-12,000 B.P. human population assert that their evidence is valid and is rejected by skeptics only because of deep-set historical biases. That assertion is not well-founded. If a bias exists, it is in the assumption that there were only three discrete migrations, the earliest of which was Clovis. The possibility that these migrations were not discrete episodes involving small founding populations, but instead may have been migratory dribbles spread over thousands of years, has implications for understanding the variation evident among modern descendant populations and the archaeological variability of Clovis. The possibility that there were early, pre-12,000 B.P. migrations that may have been wholly unrelated to Clovis and failed, may have equally important implications for why we don't know when the first people came to North America.},

	abstract = {After several years of research, there is now a consensus that America was populated from Asia through Beringia, probably at the end of the Pleistocene. But many details such as the timing, route(s), and origin of the first settlers remain uncertain. In the last decade genetic evidence has taken on a major role in elucidating the peopling of the Americas. To study the early peopling of South America, we sequenced the control region of mitochondrial DNA from 300 individuals belonging to indigenous populations of Chile and Argentina, and also obtained seven complete mitochondrial DNA sequences. We identified two novel mtDNA monophyletic clades, preliminarily designated B2l and C1b13, which together with the recently described D1g sub-haplogroup have locally high frequencies and are basically restricted to populations from the extreme south of South America. The estimated ages of D1g and B2l, about ∼15,000 years BP, together with their similar population dynamics and the high haplotype diversity shown by the networks, suggests that they probably appeared soon after the arrival of the first settlers and agrees with the dating of the earliest archaeological sites in South America (Monte Verde, Chile, 14,500 BP). One further sub-haplogroup, D4h3a5, appears to be restricted to Fuegian-Patagonian populations and reinforces our hypothesis of the continuity of the current Patagonian populations with the initial founders. Our results indicate that the extant native populations inhabiting South Chile and Argentina are a group which had a common origin, and suggest a population break between the extreme south of South America and the more northern part of the continent. Thus the early colonization process was not just an expansion from north to south, but also included movements across the Andes.},

It has an old and rich history because humans have inhabited this area since the Paleolithic. Today, the Altai region is home to numerous Turkic-speaking ethnic groups, which have been divided into northern and southern clusters based on linguistic, cultural, and anthropological traits. To untangle Altaian genetic histories, we analyzed mtDNA and Y chromosome variation in northern and southern Altaian populations. All mtDNAs were assayed by PCR-RFLP analysis and control region sequencing, and the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome was scored for more than 100 biallelic markers and 17 Y-STRs. Based on these data, we noted differences in the origin and population history of Altaian ethnic groups, with northern Altaians appearing more like Yeniseian, Ugric, and Samoyedic speakers to the north, and southern Altaians having greater affinities to other Turkic speaking populations of southern Siberia and Central Asia. Moreover, high-resolution analysis of Y chromosome haplogroup Q has allowed us to reshape the phylogeny of this branch, making connections between populations of the New World and Old World more apparent and demonstrating that southern Altaians and Native Americans share a recent common ancestor. These results greatly enhance our understanding of the peopling of Siberia and the Americas.},

	abstract = {Currently, one of the major debates about the American peopling focuses on the number of populations that originated the biological diversity found in the continent during the Holocene. The studies of craniometric variation in American human remains dating from that period have shown morphological differences between the earliest settlers of the continent and some of the later Amerindian populations. This led some investigators to suggest that these groups—known as Paleomericans and Amerindians respectively—may have arisen from two biologically different populations. On the other hand, most DNA studies performed over extant and ancient populations suggest a single migration of a population from Northeast Asia. Comparing craniometric and mtDNA data of diachronic samples from East Central Argentina dated from 8,000 to 400 years BP, we show here that even when the oldest individuals display traits attributable to Paleoamerican crania, they present the same mtDNA haplogroups as later populations with Amerindian morphology. A possible explanation for these results could be that the craniofacial differentiation was a local phenomenon resulting from random (i.e. genetic drift) and non-random factors (e.g. selection and plasticity). Local processes of morphological differentiation in America are a probable scenario if we take into consideration the rapid peopling and the great ecological diversity of this continent; nevertheless we will discuss alternative explanations as well.},

Molecular and phylogeographic analyses of B2a mitogenomes, which are absent in Eskimo–Aleut and northern Na-Dene speakers, revealed that this haplogroup arose in North America ∼11–13 ka from one of the founder Paleo-Indian B2 mitogenomes. In contrast, haplogroup A2a, which is typical of Eskimo–Aleuts and Na-Dene, but also present in the easternmost Siberian groups, originated only 4–7 ka in Alaska, led to the first Paleo-Eskimo settlement of northern Canada and Greenland, and contributed to the formation of the Na-Dene gene pool. However, mitogenomes also show that Amerindians from northern North America, without any distinction between Na-Dene and non–Na-Dene, were heavily affected by an additional and distinctive Beringian genetic input. In conclusion, most mtDNA variation (along the double-continent) stems from the first wave from Beringia, which followed the Pacific coastal route. This was accompanied or followed by a second inland migratory event, marked by haplogroups X2a and C4c, which affected all Amerindian groups of Northern North America. Much later, the ancestral A2a carriers spread from Alaska, undertaking both a westward migration to Asia and an eastward expansion into the circumpolar regions of Canada. Thus, the first American founders left the greatest genetic mark but the original maternal makeup of North American Natives was subsequently reshaped by additional streams of gene flow and local population dynamics, making a three-wave view too simplistic.},

	abstract = {Native Americans have been divided into three linguistic groups: the reasonably well-defined Eskaleut and Nadene of northern North America and the highly heterogeneous Amerind of North, Central, and South America. The heterogeneity of the Amerinds has been proposed to be the result of either multiple independent migrations or a single ancient migration with extensive in situ radiation, To investigate the origin and interrelationship of the American Indians, we examined the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in 87 Amerinds (Pima, Maya, and Ticuna of North, Central, and South America, respectively), 80 Nadene (Dogrib and Tlingit of northwest North America and Navajo of the southwest North America), and 153 Asians from 7 diverse populations. American Indian mtDNAs were found to be directly descended from five founding Asian mtDNAs and to cluster into four lineages, each characterized by a different rare Asian mtDNA marker. Lineage A is defined by a HaeIII site gain at np 663, lineage B by a 9-bp deletion between the COII and tRNALys genes, lineage C by a HincII site loss at np 13259, and lineage D by an AluI site loss at np 5176. The North, Central, and South America Amerinds were found to harbor all four lineages, demonstrating that the Amerinds originated from a common ancestral genetic stock. The genetic variation of three of the four Amerind lineages (A, C, and D) was similar with a mean value of 0.084\%, whereas the sequence variation in the fourth lineage (B) was much lower, raising the possibility of an independent arrival. By contrast, the Nadene mtDNAs were predominantly from lineage A, with 27\% of them having a Nadene-specific RsaI site loss at np 16329. The accumulated Nadene variation was only 0.021\%. These results demonstrate that the Amerind mtDNAs arose from one or maybe two Asian migrations that were distinct from the migration of the Nadene and that the Amerind populations are about four times older than the Nadene.},

One contentious issue is whether the settlement occurred by means of a single migration or multiple streams of migration from Siberia. The pattern of dispersals within the Americas is also poorly understood. To address these questions at a higher resolution than was previously possible, we assembled data from 52 Native American and 17 Siberian groups genotyped at 364,470 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Here we show that Native Americans descend from at least three streams of Asian gene flow. Most descend entirely from a single ancestral population that we call /`First American/'. However, speakers of Eskimo-Aleut languages from the Arctic inherit almost half their ancestry from a second stream of Asian gene flow, and the Na-Dene-speaking Chipewyan from Canada inherit roughly one-tenth of their ancestry from a third stream. We show that the initial peopling followed a southward expansion facilitated by the coast, with sequential population splits and little gene flow after divergence, especially in South America. A major exception is in Chibchan speakers on both sides of the Panama isthmus, who have ancestry from both North and South America.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in the phylogenetic resolution of the Y-chromosome phylogeny permits the male demographic dynamics and migratory events that occurred in Central and Southern America after the initial human spread into the Americas to be investigated at the regional level. To delve further into this issue, we examined more than 400 Native American Y chromosomes (collected in the region ranging from Mexico to South America) belonging to haplogroup Q – virtually the only branch of the Y phylogeny observed in modern-day Amerindians of Central and South America – together with 27 from Mongolia and Kamchatka. Two main founding lineages, Q1a3a1a-M3 and Q1a3a1-L54(xM3), were detected along with novel sub-clades of younger age and more restricted geographic distributions. The first was also observed in Far East Asia while no Q1a3a1-L54(xM3) Y chromosome was found in Asia except the southern Siberian-specific sub-clade Q1a3a1c-L330. Our data not only confirm a southern Siberian origin of ancestral populations that gave rise to Paleo-Indians and the differentiation of both Native American Q founding lineages in Beringia, but support their concomitant arrival in Mesoamerica, where Mexico acted as recipient for the first wave of migration, followed by a rapid southward migration, along the Pacific coast, into the Andean region. Although Q1a3a1a-M3 and Q1a3a1-L54(xM3) display overlapping general distributions, they show different patterns of evolution in the Mexican plateau and the Andean area, which can be explained by local differentiations due to demographic events triggered by the introduction of agriculture and associated with the flourishing of the Great Empires.},

	abstract = {This study aims to integrate the craniofacial morphological variation of southern South American populations with the results of mtDNA haplogroup variation, to discuss the South America peopling. Because the causes of morphological differentiation of Fueguian populations are still a controversial subject, the comparison with neutral variation could contribute to elucidate them. Samples of human remains from South America regions were used to analyze the evolutionary relationships. Several craniofacial traits observed in frontal and lateral view were analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics techniques, and the evolutionary relationships based on morphological and molecular data were established in base to ordination analyses. The results from the facial skeleton agree with those obtained from mtDNA haplogroup frequencies, with La Pampa/Chaco samples detached from the Patagonian samples. Hence, the same mechanism that accounts for the pattern of frequency of haplogroups could explain the variation found in facial skeleton among the samples. It is suggested that such geographic pattern of craniofacial and molecular diversity may reflect the effect of genetic drift that occurred in the small founding populations isolated by distance or geographic barriers. Conversely, the results obtained using the traits from the lateral view slightly differ from the molecular results, showing differences between southernmost Patagonian and the other samples. Therefore, mechanisms other than genetic drift (e.g., natural selection) could have acted to shape the pattern observed in some craniofacial structures present in the lateral view, characterized by the fact that the southernmost Patagonian samples display the most robust and dolichocephalic crania.

On average, genetic diversity estimated within Andean populations is higher than that estimated within Amazonian populations. Yet there is less genetic differentiation estimated among Andean populations than estimated among Amazonian populations. One hypothesis is that this pattern is a product of independent migrations of genetically differentiated people into South America. A competing hypothesis is that there was a single migration followed by regional isolation. In this study we address these hypotheses using mtDNA hypervariable region 1 sequences representing 21 South American groups and include new data sets for four native Peruvian communities from Tupe, Yungay, and Puno. An analysis of variance that compared the combined data from western South America to the combined data from eastern South America determined that these two regional data sets are not significantly different.

	abstract = {Accounts of long-term cultural change in Australia have emphasised the late Holocene as the period when ‘complexity’ emerged amongst foragers in Australia, associated with increased economic productivity, reduced mobility, population growth, intensified social relations and cosmological elaboration. These reconfigurations have often been interpreted as the result of continent-wide trajectories which began in the mid-Holocene, often termed ‘intensification’. These approaches have been found wanting as they homogenise diverse records of human adaptation into a single account which inexorably leads to the ethnographic present. The archaeological record tells a rather different story with fluctuating occupational intensity and even regional abandonments featuring in well-documented archaeological records. Instead, variability documented in the ethnographic and archaeological records can be understood as a product of local adaptations reflecting the operation of historically situated systems of social organisation in diverse environmental settings.},

In the absence of refits, the final state of the abandoned piece is the only remain that archaeologists have for the study of lithic reduction. The establishment of experimentally tested indexes providing strong correlations between estimated and real reduction are needed. In our work, we propose a new procedure for estimate reduction percentage. In this proposal, data are obtained from high resolution three-dimensional (3D) scans and manual measurements are avoided. The experimental test has been realized using distally retouched tools, the less suitable tools for reduction studies. The correlation levels obtained between the measured data and the estimated data increase substantially the original published from manual measurement, reaching a r2 value of 0.81 and a correlation of 0.9. The main contribution of the proposed method is the very high correlation obtained in the volume estimation (r2 = 0.89 and r = 0.94) using the 3D-based measurements. The 3D models of the unretouched and retouched flakes used in this work are free to use and accessible through an online repository.},

However, these techniques, along with others such as magnetic susceptibility, loss on ignition, and microrefuse, artefact and bone distribution analyses are rarely integrated in the study of a single site, even though they provide very different and potentially complementary data. This paper presents a comparative study of a wide range of geoarchaeological methods that were applied to the floors sediments of a Viking Age house at the site of Aðalstræti 16, in central Reykjavík, Iceland, along with more traditional artefact and bone distribution analyses, and a spatial study of floor layer boundaries and features in the building. In this study, the spatial distributions of artefacts and bones could only be understood in the light of the pH distributions, and on their own they provided limited insight into the use of space in the building. Each of the sediment analyses provided unique and valuable information about possible activity areas, with soil micromorphology proving to have the greatest interpretive power on its own. However, the interpretation potential of the geochemical methods was dramatically enhanced if they were integrated into a multi-method dataset.},

This fundamental behavioral shift is purported to signal a cognitive advance, a possible reorganization of the brain, and the origin of language. Because the earliest modern human fossils, Homo sapiens sensu stricto, are found in Africa and the adjacent region of the Levant at {\textgreater}100ka, the “human revolution” model creates a time lag between the appearance of anatomical modernity and perceived behavioral modernity, and creates the impression that the earliest modern Africans were behaviorally primitive. This view of events stems from a profound Eurocentric bias and a failure to appreciate the depth and breadth of the African archaeological record. In fact, many of the components of the “human revolution” claimed to appear at 40–50ka are found in the African Middle Stone Age tens of thousands of years earlier. These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the “human revolution” model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviors in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World. The African Middle and early Late Pleistocene hominid fossil record is fairly continuous and in it can be recognized a number of probably distinct species that provide plausible ancestors for H. sapiens. The appearance of Middle Stone Age technology and the first signs of modern behavior coincide with the appearance of fossils that have been attributed to H. helmei, suggesting the behavior of H. helmei is distinct from that of earlier hominid species and quite similar to that of modern people. If on anatomical and behavioral grounds H. helmei is sunk into H. sapiens, the origin of our species is linked with the appearance of Middle Stone Age technology at 250–300ka.},

Most of this debate has been over the empirical record for the appearance and distribution of a set of traits that have come to be accepted as indicators of behavioral modernity. This debate has resulted in a series of competing models that we explicate here, and the traits are typically used as the test implications for these models. However, adequate tests of hypotheses and models rest on robust test implications, and we argue here that the current set of test implications suffers from three main problems: (1) Many are empirically derived from and context‐specific to the richer European record, rendering them problematic for use in the primarily tropical and subtropical African continent. (2) They are ambiguous because other processes can be invoked, often with greater parsimony, to explain their character. (3) Many lack theoretical justification. In addition, there are severe taphonomic problems in the application of these test implications across differing spans of time. To provide adequate tests of these models, archaeologists must first subject these test implications to rigorous discussion, which is initiated here.},

	abstract = {The fossil record suggests that modern human morphology evolved in Africa between 150,000 and 50,000 years ago, when the sole inhabitants of Eurasia were the Neanderthals and other equally nonmodern people. However, the earliest modern or near-modern Africans were behaviorally (archaeologically) indistinguishable from their nonmodern, Eurasian contemporaries, and it was only around 50,000-40,000 years ago that a major behavioral difference developed. Archaeological indications of this difference include the oldest indisputable ornaments (or art broadly understood); the oldest evidence for routine use of bone, ivory, and shell to produce formal (standardized) artifacts; greatly accelerated variation in stone artifact assemblages through time and space; and hunting-gathering innovations that promoted significantly larger populations. As a complex, the novel traits imply fully modern cognitive and communicative abilities, or more succinctly, the fully modern capacity for Culture. The competitive advantage of this capacity is obvious, and preliminary dates suggest that it appeared in Africa about 50,000 years ago and then successively in western Asia, eastern Europe, and western Europe, in keeping with an African origin. Arguably, the development of modern behavior depended on a neural change broadly like those that accompanied yet earlier archaeologically detectable behavioral advances. This explanation is problematic, however, because the putative change was in brain organization, not size, and fossil skulls provide little or no secure evidence for brain structure. Other potential objections to a neural advance in Africa 50,000-40,000 years ago or to the wider “Out-of-Africa” hypothesis, include archaeological evidence (1) that some Neanderthals were actually capable of fully modern behavior and (2) that some Africans were behaviorally modern more than 90,000 years ago.},

The continuous evolution of flake technology in North China from 40ka to 20ka supports the hypothesis of “Continuity with Hybridization” of Chinese ancient populations from a cultural perspective.

The variation of behavior after the appearance of H. sapiens in China and elsewhere demands research into behavioral variability and its causes, instead of treating modern behavior as a single, homogeneous list of features.},

China is an extremely important region where many ancient human fossils were collected along with numerous associated faunal remains and artefacts. These cultural remains, unearthed from different areas in the country and covering a long time span, will help clarify the controversy. The study of cultural materials in China is expected to shed important light on biological evolutionary patterns and social and technical developments of those early humans as well as their environmental conditions. Based on the analysis of Chinese fossils and associated materials, in conjunction with some genetic studies, this paper aims at evaluating each of the two theories in order to stimulate more discussions. Our study suggests that the evolutionary model of “Continuity with Hybridization“ is most relevant in reflecting the current understanding of human evolutionary history in China. Furthermore, we propose that the concept of regional diversity of evolutionary models should be seriously considered to illustrate different evolutionary modes applied to different parts of the world.},

	abstract = {Fossils of early hominins have been found exclusively in Africa. While the australopiths only spread within Africa, members of the genus Homo were the first to leave their home continent, roughly 2 million years ago, thus expanding their settlement area considerably. Once “out of Africa,” groups of Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, or other early Homo species moved in several waves to East and Southeast Asia, while other groups, possibly through the Levantine Corridor and crossing the Caucasus, entered Europe. The oldest artifact assemblages outside of Africa are of Oldowan type, while in Africa at the same time the techno-complex of the Acheulean had begun to evolve, which came to Eurasia much later. In Europe, the Neanderthals, the only indigenous European hominins, evolved out of later populations of Homo heidelbergensis. At the end of the last glacial period, the Neanderthals enlarged their originally exclusive European settlement area, expanding into the Near East, parts of Central Asia, and even as far as the Altai region in Siberia. While the Neanderthals apparently never entered Africa, they started their movement “out of Europe” and into Asia at about the same time that anatomically modern humans (AMH), who originated in Africa, started their movement “out of Africa,” also heading first into Asia. Sahul was colonized by AMH earlier than Europe, which was first entered about 45,000 years ago, when the Neanderthals were still living there. Today, modern humans are the only existing hominin species, inhabiting nearly every part of the world. During their expansions, the Neanderthals and AMH not only mixed with each other – at least in the Near East – but apparently both interbred with a third hominin group, the Denisovans, who seem to have moved specifically into East and/or Southeast Asia.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly difficult to defend the existence of an absolute, abrupt break between “simple” MSA/Middle Paleolithic (Mode 3) technologies or human adaptions on the one hand and those of a more “complex” or “modern” LSA/Upper Paleolithic on the other hand. What went on during both blocks of cultural time was far from uniformity or stasis–quite to the contrary. Cultural evolution, as a long, drawn-out, mosaic process, must be disentangled from the question of the purely European replacement of the Neandertals by African-originated Homo sapiens idaltu/sapiens. A brief review of the African and European records points to the arbitrariness of the so-called Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition and to the notion of unilineal cultural evolution. The utility of the “transition” idea is as questionable as is the reality and homogeneity of the MSA/MP and LSA/UP culture-stratigraphic constructs. Variability is more relevant than essentialism in the study of any Paleolithic cultural adaptations; the notion of change with considerable continuity is more appropriate to describe what was going on throughout the late Upper Pleistocene than saltation. Demographic factors are probably more important in understanding many of the important changes that characterized the last 50-70,000 years of the Pleistocene than putative advances in human capacities-- mental and linguistic. The growth of human populations during MIS 3 seems to have led to increasingly complex technologies, subsistence intensification, burgeoning social relations mediated through symbolic behavior with material manifestations in “art” and personal ornamentation. The time has come to really acknowledge and grapple with complexity (e.g., multilineality, non-directionality, regional and functional variation) in the development of “modern-type” hunting-gathering adaptations among humans throughout the Old World during the last phases of the Paleolithic, regardless of the 19th-early 20th century labels archeologists may still use to describe classic culture-stratigraphic subdivisions.},

One of the most persistent of these is the assumed correlation between blade technologies, Upper Paleolithic industries, and anatomically (and behaviorally) modern humans. In this paper, we review some of the evidence for the production of early blade technologies in Eurasia and Africa dating to the late Lower and the Middle Paleolithic. The basic techniques for blade production appeared thousands of years before the Upper Paleolithic, and there is no justification for linking blades per se to any particular aspect of hominid anatomy or to any major change in the behavioral capacities of hominids. It is true that blades came to dominate the archaeological records of western Eurasia and Africa after 40,000 years ago, perhaps as a consequence of increasing reliance on complex composite tools during the Upper Paleolithic. At the same time, evidence from other regions of the world demonstrates that evolutionary trends in Pleistocene Eurasia were historically contingent and not universal.

From 195–130 kyr ago, the world was in a fluctuating but predominantly glacial stage (marine isotope stage MIS6); much of Africa was cooler and drier, and dated archaeological sites are rare. Here we show that by 164 kyr ago (12 kyr) at Pinnacle Point (on the south coast of South Africa) humans expanded their diet to include marine resources, perhaps as a response to these harsh environmental conditions. The earliest previous evidence for human use of marine resources and coastal habitats was dated to 125 kyr ago. Coincident with this diet and habitat expansion is an early use and modification of pigment, probably for symbolic behaviour, as well as the production of bladelet stone tool technology, previously dated to post-70 kyr ago. Shellfish may have been crucial to the survival of these early humans as they expanded their home ranges to include coastlines and followed the shifting position of the coast when sea level fluctuated over the length of MIS6.},

However, high levels of social tolerance, as seen among living humans, are a necessary prerequisite to life at higher population densities and to the kinds of cooperative cultural behaviors essential to these demographic models. Here we provide data on craniofacial feminization (reduction in average brow ridge projection and shortening of the upper facial skeleton) in Homo sapiens from the Middle Pleistocene to recent times. We argue that temporal changes in human craniofacial morphology reflect reductions in average androgen reactivity (lower levels of adult circulating testosterone or reduced androgen receptor densities), which in turn reflect the evolution of enhanced social tolerance since the Middle Pleistocene.},

The Grotte des Fées at Châtelperron (France) is the remaining case of such a potential Châtelperronian–Aurignacian contemporaneity, but reanalysis shows that its stratification is poor and unclear, the bone assemblage is carnivore-accumulated, the putative interstratified Aurignacian lens in level B4 is made up for the most part of Châtelperronian material, the upper part of the sequence is entirely disturbed, and the few Aurignacian items in levels B4-5 represent isolated intrusions into otherwise in situ Châtelperronian deposits. As elsewhere in southwestern Europe, this evidence confirms that the Aurignacian postdates the Châtelperronian and that the latter’s cultural innovations are better explained as the Neandertals’ independent development of behavioral modernity.},

The continuous evolution of flake technology in North China from 40ka to 20ka supports the hypothesis of “Continuity with Hybridization” of Chinese ancient populations from a cultural perspective. On the premise of this model, seeking cultural innovations of Chinese ancient populations should focus on evolutionary processes leading to individual behaviors rather than identifying modern behaviors using a list summarized from materials derived from findings in Europe and Africa. The variation of behavior after the appearance of H. sapiens in China and elsewhere demands research into behavioral variability and its causes, instead of treating modern behavior as a single, homogeneous list of features.},

	abstract = {The “Weak Garden of Eden” model for the origin and dispersal of modern humans (Harpendinget al., 1993) posits that modern humans spread into separate regions from a restricted source, around 100ka (thousand years ago), then passed through population bottlenecks. Around 50ka, dramatic growth occurred within dispersed populations that were genetically isolated from each other. Population growth began earliest in Africa and later in Eurasia and is hypothesized to have been caused by the invention and spread of a more efficient Later Stone Age/Upper Paleolithic technology, which developed in equatorial Africa. Climatic and geological evidence suggest an alternative hypothesis for Late Pleistocene population bottlenecks and releases. The last glacial period was preceded by one thousand years of the coldest temperatures of the Later Pleistocene (∼71–70ka), apparently caused by the eruption of Toba, Sumatra. Toba was the largest known explosive eruption of the Quaternary. Toba's volcanic winter could have decimated most modern human populations, especially outside of isolated tropical refugia. Release from the bottleneck could have occurred either at the end of this hypercold phase, or 10,000 years later, at the transition from cold oxygen isotope stage 4 to warmer stage 3. The largest populations surviving through the bottleneck should have been found in the largest tropical refugia, and thus in equatorial Africa. High genetic diversity in modern Africans may thus reflect a less severe bottleneck rather than earlier population growth. Volcanic winter may have reduced populations to levels low enough for founder effects, genetic drift and local adaptations to produce rapid population differentiation. If Toba caused the bottlenecks, then modern human races may have differentiated abruptly, only 70 thousand years ago.},

	abstract = {Microblade technology was important in hunter-gatherer adaptations throughout northern Asia from the late Pleistocene through the Pleistocene/Holocene transition and beyond. To date, most studies from the region are concerned with origins, technological lineages, and culture history. In contrast, we direct attention to issues involving the role of microlithic technology in adaptive strategies and problem solution among north Asian hunter-gatherers by looking at artifact design and risk analysis. First we discuss the function of Asian microblades and outline the general costs and benefits of organic points with microblade insets over simple organic points and flaked stone points, as well as the relative advantages of wedge-shaped and split-pebble microcores in terms of the Z-score model. We conclude with a review of the role of microlithic technology as a risk-minimizing strategy of Arctic and sub-Arctic large-game hunters in northern Asia and suggest further lines of inquiry.},

	abstract = {Though present before the Last Glacial Maximum, microblade technology is uncommon in the lithic assemblages of north-central China until the onset of the Younger Dryas (12,900–11,600 calBP). While it is clear that microblades here and elsewhere were connected with mobile adaptations organized around hunting, the attendant assumption that they served primarily in hunting weaponry is not. The archaeological record of north-central China, including excavations at Pigeon Mountain (QG3) and Shuidonggou Locality 12 (SDG 12) in Ningxia Autonomous Region, and Dadiwan in Gansu Providence, and a handful of bone/antler tools slotted for microblade inserts, indicate a more direct linkage to mobility. These data suggest the rise of microblade technology in Younger Dryas north-central China was mainly the result of microblades used as insets in composite knives needed for production of sophisticated cold weather clothing needed for a winter mobile hunting adaptation akin to the residentially mobile pattern Binford termed “serial specialist.” Limited time and opportunities compressed this production into a very narrow seasonal window, putting a premium on highly streamlined routines to which microblade technology was especially well-suited.},

	abstract = {Material evidence from the Korean early Late Paleolithic, dating between the end of MIS 3 and the beginning of MIS 2, shows that Paleolithic tools were primarily comprised of simply made cores and flakes and a small number of blades. The blade toolkits were introduced, but did not immediately replace coexisting simplified forms of tools. Simple core and flake tool assemblages (SCFA) were dominant, and were maintained without any positive cultural or technological modifications during this period of time.

Revolutionary appearances of behavioral modernity did not occur during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic period. Efficient behavioral innovations rapidly extending across the peninsula occurred only after that period of time. The blades seem not to be regarded truly as a technological marker which normally replaced preexisting simple stone tools; the advantages of SCFA, which comprise of agile and expedient toolkits, played a key role. This implies that the Korean Mode 4 assemblage during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic does not truly represent a technocomplex breakthrough.

The puzzling lack of more standardized tools should be viewed not as a conventional cultural tradition. More diverse transmitted elements for interpreting the preferences for expedient tools among forager groups may be required.},

	abstract = {The origin and spread of behavioral modernity has been one of the most hotly debated paleoanthropological issues during the past two decades or so. Researchers have examined changes in technology, subsistence, and social organization. The Upper (Late) Paleolithic is traditionally characterized by the establishment of a blade industry. Patterns of lithic technology closely reflect settlement and subsistence systems, and any change can be explained in terms of interplay among various factors, including technological constraints, raw material availability, mobility, and extended social networks in changing environments. A recent increase in archaeological excavations and advances in chronology allow us to discuss Late Pleistocene cultural evolution in Korea in more detail. Two notable, seemingly contradictory features during the early Late Paleolithic are recognized: (1) some lithic assemblages are characterized by small flake artifacts made of local quartzite and vein quartz, and (2) other assemblages include new artifact types—blades and tanged points—manufactured with hitherto largely unused fine-grained materials. Late Paleolithic technological characteristics emerged ca. 40,000-30,000 BP, but not until the onset of the OIS 2 did formal artifacts, such as blades and blade tools, became predominant in lithic assemblages. This change is viewed as a slow, evolutionary process that eventually culminated in the Late Paleolithic transition.},

Here we use this in combination with an alternate measure, the Tip Cross-Sectional Perimeter, a more accurate proxy of the force needed to penetrate a target to a lethal depth. The current study discusses this measure and uses it to analyze a collection of measurements from African Middle Stone Age pointed stone artifacts. Several point types that were rejected in previous studies are statistically indistinguishable from ethnographic projectile points using this new measure. The ramifications of this finding for a Middle Stone Age origin of complex projectile technology is discussed.},

In an earlier paper [Gravina B, Mellars P, Bronk Ramsey C (2005) Nature 483:51–56], we published a series of radiocarbon accelerator mass spectrometer measurements for the site of Châtelperron in central France, which had been claimed to show a clear “interstratification” of successive levels of Neanderthal and modern human occupation, on the basis of excavations carried out by Henri Delporte in the 1950s. This interpretation has recently been challenged by Zilhão and colleagues [Zilhão J, d'Errico F, Bordes J-G, Lenoble A, Texier J-P, Rigaud J-P (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:12643–12648], who suggest that the deposits excavated in the 1950s consisted largely, if not entirely, of the unstratified “backdirt” of the earlier, 19th century excavations on the site. We show here that the excavation backdirt interpretation for the Châtelperron stratigraphy can be refuted from many different aspects of the stratigraphic, radiocarbon, and archaeological evidence. We reassess the significance of this site for current models of the coexistence and interactions between Neanderthal and anatomically modern populations in western Europe.},

The continuous evolution of flake technology in North China from 40ka to 20ka supports the hypothesis of “Continuity with Hybridization” of Chinese ancient populations from a cultural perspective. On the premise of this model, seeking cultural innovations of Chinese ancient populations should focus on evolutionary processes leading to individual behaviors rather than identifying modern behaviors using a list summarized from materials derived from findings in Europe and Africa. The variation of behavior after the appearance of H. sapiens in China and elsewhere demands research into behavioral variability and its causes, instead of treating modern behavior as a single, homogeneous list of features.},

The onset of the Upper Paleolithic in China dates to ca. 35,000–30,000 years ago and is marked by the appearance of a few body decorations and well-shaped bone tools that were added to stone tool assemblages, including core-and-flake tools in North China and cobble tools in South China. The proliferation of blade assemblages in northwest China is interpreted as the cultural impact or the physical presence of bearers of blade industries from western Eurasia. The ensuing appearance of microblade assemblages in North China by 23,000–22,000 years ago reflects the use of local siliceous crystalline nodules by a population that recognized the advantages of this raw material. At that time in South China, prehistoric artisans continued to shape their stone objects from the available flat river cobbles. During the later part of the Chinese Upper Paleolithic (ca. 21,000–10,000 BP), foragers also made bone tools, antler objects, pottery, and shell tools, which laid the technological foundations for the early Neolithic period. One difficulty in this research is that human fossils are rare. Few are well dated and morphological, cultural, and biological interpretations are hotly debated.

	abstract = {This study examines settlement system changes before and during the Last Glacial Maximum in central Japan. Human mobility is estimated from raw material procurement to infer how Upper Paleolithic hunter–gatherers acquired necessary materials. Seventy-four sites are investigated with the methodological assumption that the lithic raw materials were obtained through an embedded strategy.

Changes in settlement patterns through time are reconstructed in the following ways. First, around 30,000 14Cyrs BP, hunter–gatherer territories formed between high-quality lithic raw material sources approximately 200 km apart, constrained by the distribution of lithic raw material sources and the area's terrain and suggesting that their subsistence activities were also conducted in those prime areas. Second, during the Last Glacial Maximum, hunter–gatherers still acquired lithic raw materials from distant sources around 200 km apart, while the area of hunting activities using spear points decreased to an 80 km radius. As territories shrank, large manufacturing sites for making spear points appeared in the vicinity of high-quality raw material sources in this period.

In sum, the embedded lithic procurement system in Japan during this period was largely changed by ecological deterioration. Patterns transitioned from general resource exploitation in the early period to seasonal movement between isolated resource-rich areas during the Last Glacial Maximum, resulting in significant change from the mobile hunter–gather society at the end of the Late Pleistocene to the sedentary society of the Holocene.},

	abstract = {During MIS 3 and 2, a large proportion of the entire lithic repertories of the Paleolithic episode are represented in the Korean Paleolithic data. The diversification in Late Paleolithic lithic data in Korea calls into question the utility of a unilinear model of successive cultural stages defined by cultural markers. The recent increase in the number of well-controlled archaeological record with radiometric data during MIS 3 and 2 does not support a straightforward relationship with the conventional set of chrono-typological criteria. Radiocarbon dates were examined for reliability in artifact-bearing horizons from 39 Paleolithic sites in Korea. Using high-resolution examples, this paper examines if the transition from early Late Paleolithic (Stage 1) to late Late Paleolithic (Stage 2) is defined by clear-cut discontinuities. Results are not compatible with the traditional expectation of differences in toolkit assemblages between cultural stages. It is concluded that the conventionally known cultural stages are limited for adequately representing the updated data, because of the complex tempo and the non-directional mode shown during transitions. Although distinctive and varied cultural markers are observed, there is also a considerable overlap in the lithic assemblages of different stages. The cultural shifts and diversifications show both saltational and gradualistic shifting during MIS 3 and 2. Results of this paper provide an insight for reconstructing a workable (regionally distinctive) chrono-typological framework.},

	abstract = {Material evidence from the Korean early Late Paleolithic, dating between the end of MIS 3 and the beginning of MIS 2, shows that Paleolithic tools were primarily comprised of simply made cores and flakes and a small number of blades. The blade toolkits were introduced, but did not immediately replace coexisting simplified forms of tools. Simple core and flake tool assemblages (SCFA) were dominant, and were maintained without any positive cultural or technological modifications during this period of time.

Revolutionary appearances of behavioral modernity did not occur during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic period. Efficient behavioral innovations rapidly extending across the peninsula occurred only after that period of time. The blades seem not to be regarded truly as a technological marker which normally replaced preexisting simple stone tools; the advantages of SCFA, which comprise of agile and expedient toolkits, played a key role. This implies that the Korean Mode 4 assemblage during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic does not truly represent a technocomplex breakthrough.

The puzzling lack of more standardized tools should be viewed not as a conventional cultural tradition. More diverse transmitted elements for interpreting the preferences for expedient tools among forager groups may be required.},

This has often been explained as the result of an indigenous development. However, the ‘heterogenic’ character of Upper Paleolithic industries is the result of the continuing influx of modern human populations via two different routes: (1) from Siberia and (2) from southern China. Blade technology from Siberia appeared in the Korean peninsula around 35 000 BP and coexisted with core and flake stone industries carried by modern humans from southern China and Southeast Asia throughout the Upper Paleolithic. This explanation is based on the current observation of patterns of Upper Paleolithic industries in East Asia. Blade industries have been found only in the northern part of East Asia while none have been reported in southern China, although modern Homo evidently dispersed via two different routes from the Near East. The ‘North-South Model’ of Modern Homo migrations into the Korean peninsula is supported by a genetic analysis of the Y-chromosome of the modern population in this region. Continuing influx of modern human population from both origins to the peninsula can explain the consistent presence of Upper Paleolithic industries that appear heterogenic.},

The cultural aspects of the people from MIS 3 to MIS 2 show distinctive regional differences. The unique hunting cultures of the late Upper Pleistocene were created according to each local environment. Various kinds of spears and other implements were produced in these local areas, including tanged points, bilateral points, knife-shaped tools, and bifacial points.

Sea level changes in the Upper Pleistocene caused different patterns in human migration in this region. Land bridges at the time of lowered sea level disappeared during the period of climatic warming and could not provide any terrestrial route for human movement between two regions.

Given the archaeological examples from around the East Sea/Sea of Japan, human activity was considerably limited between countries. People of the Late Paleolithic in Korea and Japan shared and developed flake techniques, such as the blade and micro-blade techniques. During MIS 3 and MIS 2, the emergence of the Late Paleolithic in Japan was very likely influenced by the Late Paleolithic in Korea. Human activity between Korea and Japan is very important to understanding the Late Paleolithic culture in Northeast Asia.},

The climate changes over the last 72 ka can be compared directly with those recorded at Upper Paleolithic and Incipient Jomon sites on the basis of a revised age model for the Lake Nojiri sediment cores and the revised 14C dates, calibrated after IntCal09. Fossil bones of megafauna from the Tategahana site beside the lake have been placed ca. 53–37 ka cal BP, in the relatively warm, temperate climate of the early MIS 3. Part of the Tategahana site was interpreted as a kill and butchery site, although the presence of the “big game hunters” is still uncertain, as so far there is no reliable archaeological evidence in the Japanese archipelago dating back to the Middle Paleolithic. The number of Paleolithic sites increased suddenly after 38 ka cal BP around Lake Nojiri. This seems to coincide with the timing of the migration of Homo sapiens into the Japanese archipelago. The climate had been gradually cooling toward the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, the area around Lake Nojiri in the late MIS 3 seems to have been a suitable place for the subsistence of hunter-gatherers. Backed blade industries (ca. 29–20 ka cal BP), point-tool industries (ca. 22–19 ka cal BP), and microblade industries (20–16 ka cal BP) were characteristic of the Late Upper Paleolithic. The number of sites around Lake Nojiri decreased significantly during the LGM. At the end of the LGM, an abrupt change of vegetation, from subarctic conifer forest to deciduous broadleaf forest, had occurred around 14 ka, and human activities became prominent around Lake Nojiri, as shown by the linear-relief pottery group (ca. 15–13 ka cal BP). The number of sites seems to have decreased slightly during the Younger Dyras cooling event. Patterns of human occupation around Lake Nojiri show the influence of global and local climate changes.},

To date, similar stone axes have not been reported in Upper Palaeolithic sites in the continental regions of China, Korea, and Russia. These edge-ground axes appear to be independent inventions of the first Homo sapiens to settle the Japanese islands, and they are one manifestation of modern human behavior.

The larger edge-ground axes appear to have been used for felling trees and for modifying wood. When the blades were damaged, these axes were reworked into smaller forms and reused for processing hide. The flake tools that were parts of the same lithic assemblages as the axes were probably hunting tools, but presently there is no evidence they were used for hunting the large mammals, such as Naumann’s elephants, that inhabited the Japanese islands at that time. Some of these flake tools were made of obsidian obtained from an island in the Pacific off the coast of Japan, demonstrating these early inhabitants of the Japanese islands had some kind of watercraft for crossing ocean waters. This is also a type of modern human behavior. Further, around 40,000 cal BP there was no land connection between the continent and Japan, so these first Homo sapiens settlers of the islands had to arrive by crossing water.

The humans possessing these edge-ground axes formed circular settlements which they inhabited seasonally. They most likely had a clear awareness of group and of cooperative behavior.},

The burrows are straight to slightly curved in horizontal (plan) view and gently inclined in lateral (sectional) view. They are interpreted as having been produced by rodent-like mammals based on their size and architecture. The significance of such burrow-bearing layers as a characteristic stratigraphic marker unit is demonstrated by high burrow abundance, consistent stratigraphic position, lack of stratigraphic recurrence at these sites, and widespread geographic extent. Three dating methods, tephrochronology, radiocarbon, and OSL dating, were used to infer the age of these burrow-bearing layers. The dating results indicate that they were formed between ca. 40,000 and 25,000 yr (MIS 3−2), and this suggests that this layer can be used as a stratigraphic time-marker in late Pleistocene paleosol sequences for this region.},

(Pigou 1925). If Marshall's method is relevant to the way Boyd and Richerson work, then their new book is evidence that their theorising has reached an advanced stage. In their new book Not by Genes Alone (hereinafter, NBGA) there are none of the dense maths that distinguished their influential book Culture and the Evolutionary Process (1985), instead there are numerous examples drawn from the human sciences. The main point of this new book is to show that Darwinian evolutionary theory and methods are essential and productive tools for the analysis of human culture. This is a theme that Boyd and Richerson have been promoting since the late 1970s, but NBGA presents a more accessible account of their cultural evolutionary program and outlines a manifesto for future research. The book is aimed at readers in social science and humanities departments, with no graphs, only a single equation buried in the endnotes, axiom-like chapter headings, and case studies drawn from across the human sciences. The publication of this new synthesis of their ideas provides a good opportunity to review the main arguments of Boyd and Richerson's work as described in NBGA and evaluate the impact their program has had on archaeological research.},

The point typology most widely employed in the Great Basin before about 1980 (the Berkeley typology) uses weight to distinguish larger dart points from smaller, but similarly shaped, arrow points. The typology commonly used today (the Monitor typology) uses basal width to distinguish wide-based dart points from narrow-based arrow points. The two typologies are in general agreement except in central Nevada, where some dart points are light, hence incorrectly typed by the Berkeley typology, and in eastern California, where some arrow points are wide-based, hence incorrectly typed by the Monitor typology. Scarce raw materials and resharpening may explain why dart points are sometimes light in central Nevada. That arrow point basal width is more variable in eastern California than central Nevada likely reflects differences in the cultural processes attending the spread and subsequent maintenance of bow-and-arrow technology in these two localities.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of the Clovis–Folsom transition for understanding the history of western North America, its spatiotemporal dynamics remains unclear. Here we report a three-part study in which we investigated the transition using radiocarbon dates from Clovis and Folsom sites. In the first part of the study, we used dates from Folsom site-phases to determine when and where Folsom originated. In the second part of the study, we employed Clovis and Folsom dates in analyses designed to determine whether Folsom spread via demic diffusion or cultural diffusion. In the third part of the study we investigated the velocity of the Clovis–Folsom transition. The analyses suggest that Folsom first appeared around 12,800 calBP in the northern High Plains and spread north and south from there. They also suggest that the spread of Folsom was, at least in part, the result of population expansion. In addition, the analyses indicate that the spread of Folsom was relatively fast for a prehistoric diffusion but well below the maximum velocity that has been estimated for such events. These findings, in turn, have implications for the hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the Clovis–Folsom transition. They refute the idea that the Clovis–Folsom transition resulted from an extraterrestrial impact over northern North America at 12,900 ± 100 calBP but are consistent with the alternative proposal that the transition was a response to climate-driven environmental change.},

Existing techniques fail to provide a generic measure of retouching for all chipped stone artefacts. A fast and reliable index is proposed which measures retouch in terms of the invasiveness of flake scars on the surfaces of complete stone artefacts. Unlike other measures, the index of invasiveness is well suited to the analysis of bifacially worked artefacts such as bifacial points and bifaces. Experimental tests demonstrate a strong correlation between the index and measures of reduction based on diminishing flake weight and numbers of retouch blows. Inter-observer reliability is also demonstrated through the use of a blind test. Limitations of the method are discussed, although potential techniques for surmounting problems are identified. An archaeological application of the index demonstrates the utility of the method in the context of regional assemblage variability in northern Australia.},

The discipline has well established and tested methods to track change through time and to evaluate the function of artifacts that depend upon measures of variation in the archaeological record. Although a critical concept, the means by which variation in material culture is generated is not well understood. This paper explores one source of variation, copying errors, and systematically examines how cultural transmission processes act to amplify, reduce, or maintain such variation. Using simple models, we generate expected distributions for the amount of variation that occurs through time under varying circumstances. This variation is caused by small errors that are transmitted from one person to another in the propagation and replication of cultural traits. These baseline values provide useful null models for explaining variation in prehistoric assemblages of artifacts. We use measurements of projectile points from Owens Valley and Woodland ceramics from Illinois to demonstrate the value of this approach.},

	abstract = {The “Weak Garden of Eden” model for the origin and dispersal of modern humans (Harpendinget al., 1993) posits that modern humans spread into separate regions from a restricted source, around 100ka (thousand years ago), then passed through population bottlenecks. Around 50ka, dramatic growth occurred within dispersed populations that were genetically isolated from each other. Population growth began earliest in Africa and later in Eurasia and is hypothesized to have been caused by the invention and spread of a more efficient Later Stone Age/Upper Paleolithic technology, which developed in equatorial Africa. Climatic and geological evidence suggest an alternative hypothesis for Late Pleistocene population bottlenecks and releases. The last glacial period was preceded by one thousand years of the coldest temperatures of the Later Pleistocene (∼71–70ka), apparently caused by the eruption of Toba, Sumatra. Toba was the largest known explosive eruption of the Quaternary. Toba's volcanic winter could have decimated most modern human populations, especially outside of isolated tropical refugia. Release from the bottleneck could have occurred either at the end of this hypercold phase, or 10,000 years later, at the transition from cold oxygen isotope stage 4 to warmer stage 3. The largest populations surviving through the bottleneck should have been found in the largest tropical refugia, and thus in equatorial Africa. High genetic diversity in modern Africans may thus reflect a less severe bottleneck rather than earlier population growth. Volcanic winter may have reduced populations to levels low enough for founder effects, genetic drift and local adaptations to produce rapid population differentiation. If Toba caused the bottlenecks, then modern human races may have differentiated abruptly, only 70 thousand years ago.},

Garrod \& Bate (1937, Excavations at the Wady El-Mughara, Volume 1. Oxford: Clarendon Press) interpreted the archaeological record of both levels as being indicative of domestic occupational activities. Jelinek et al. (1973, Palaeorient1, 151–183) proposed that the presence of articulated limb bones of Dama mesopotamica in the Level B sediments below the cave chimney indicated that the cave was used as a natural game trap. They also noted that the white ash layers in Level C extended across the whole cave, and proposed that this was due to the burning of natural vegetation in the cave. This study aims at clarifying the modes of occupation during these periods. Level B sediments closely resemble the terra rossa soil that is common in this region. Burning activity is inferred from charcoal fragments seen in thin sections. A minor wood ash component is present based on the preponderance of phytoliths with a variable morphology as compared to those with a consistent morphology, as well as phytoliths with shapes characteristic of those formed in wood and bark of local trees. Thus fires were produced in the cave during this period. The cave may also have been used as a game trap. Level C is composed of multiple layers of brown, black and white sediments. Micromorphology, mineralogy and phytolith analyses all show that these layers are mixtures of terra rossa soil and ash, with the latter being abundant in the white layers. The phytoliths in these layers are derived almost entirely from wood and bark, and not from grasses. These observations are consistent with a domestic occupational mode.},

It has special global significance for its record of early pelagic fishing and ancient shell fish hooks. It is also of regional significance for its early occupation and comparatively large assemblage of Pleistocene stone artefacts. Three major findings arise from our study of the stone artefacts. First, there is little change in lithic technology over the 42,000 year sequence, with the most noticeable change being the addition of new artefact types and raw materials in the mid-Holocene. Second, the assemblage is dominated by small chert cores and implements rather than pebble tools and choppers, a pattern we argue pattern, we argue, that is common in island SE Asian sites as opposed to mainland SE Asian sites. Third, the Jerimalai assemblage bears a striking resemblance to the assemblage from Liang Bua, argued by the Liang Bua excavation team to be associated with Homo floresiensis. We argue that the near proximity of these two islands along the Indonesian island chain (c.100 km apart), the long antiquity of modern human occupation in the region (as documented at Jerimalai), and the strong resemblance of distinctive flake stone technologies seen at both sites, raises the intriguing possibility that both the Liang Bua and Jerimalai assemblages were created by modern humans.},

Two inflection points, one within the Middle Palaeolithic ca 75 ka and the other between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic ca 45 ka, are examined in light of recently-discovered evidence for rapid climate change and environmental deterioration. It is proposed that both periods mark regional extinctions and turnovers of hominin populations. The first of these occurred among early Homo sapiens, the second among Neanderthals. Each event was followed by dispersal of hominin populations into the Levant from adjacent regions. Differences in Middle vs. Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens’ long-term success in the Levant may reflect recently-evolved strategies for coping with rapid climate change and with colder arid habitats.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The chronostratigraphic data from Geißenklösterle and Hohle Fels suggest that the Swabian Aurignacian began about 40,000 calendar years ago. Although the human fossil evidence is sparse, Neanderthals produced the Middle Paleolithic assemblages, and we assume that modern humans produced the Aurignacian. Swabia is one of the areas in which the Aurignacian was established at an early date. Lithic and organic artifacts document a clear shift in technology between the Middle Paleolithic and the Aurignacian. With a few exceptions, the density of cultural material from Aurignacian deposits surpasses that of the Middle Paleolithic deposits. These data suggest that the intensity of occupation was higher during the Aurignacian than during the Middle Paleolithic. This paper presents the evidence for and against continuity across this boundary. An assessment of the “Danube Corridor ” and the “Population Vacuum ” models concludes that these are plausible scenarios for the beginning of the Aurignacian and end of the Middle Paleolithic. While we do not expect interpretations that apply to Swabia to apply directly to other regions, the Swabian data point to explanations for the extinction of Neanderthals and the territorial and},

	abstract = {Paleoclimate records from the western Mediterranean have been used to further understand the role of climatic changes in the replacement of archaic human populations inhabiting South Iberia. Marine sediments from the Balearic basin (ODP Site 975) was analysed at high resolution to obtain both geochemical and mineralogical data. These data were compared with climate records from nearby areas. Baexcces was used to characterize marine productivity and then related to climatic variability. Since variations in productivity were the consequence of climatic oscillations, climate/productivity events have been established. Sedimentary regime, primary marine productivity and oxygen conditions at the time of population replacement were reconstructed by means of a multiproxy approach. Climatic/oceanographic variations correlate well with Homo spatial and occupational patterns in Southern Iberia. It was found that low ventilation (U/Th), high river supply (Mg/Al), low aridity (Zr/Al) and low values of Baexcess coefficient of variation, may be linked with Neanderthal hospitable conditions. We attempt to support recent findings which claim that Neanderthals populations continued to inhabit southern Iberia between 30 and ∼28 ky cal BP and that this persistence was due to the specific characteristics of South Iberian climatic refugia. Comparisons of our data with other marine and continental records appear to indicate that conditions in South Iberia were highly inhospitable at ∼24 ky cal BP. Thus, it is proposed that the final disappearance of Neanderthals in this region could be linked with these extreme conditions.},

To assess the cogency of this argument, we construct and analyze an interspecific cultural competition model based on the Lotka−Volterra model, which is widely used in ecology, but which incorporates the culture level of a species as a variable interacting with population size. We investigate the conditions under which a difference in culture level between cognitively equivalent species, or alternatively a difference in underlying learning ability, may produce competitive exclusion of a comparatively (although not absolutely) large local Neanderthal population by an initially smaller modern human population. We find, in particular, that this competitive exclusion is more likely to occur when population growth occurs on a shorter timescale than cultural change, or when the competition coefficients of the Lotka−Volterra model depend on the difference in the culture levels of the interacting species.},

	abstract = {After more than 100,000 years of evolutionary success in Western Eurasia, Neanderthals rapidly went extinct between 40,000 and 30,000 years ago, almost coinciding with the spread of Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens (AMHS) in Europe. Several scenarios relate their extinction to competition with AMHS, climatic changes during the last glacial period or a combination of both. Here we propose a much simpler scenario, in which the cannibalistic behaviour of Neanderthals may have played a major role in their eventual extinction. We show that this trait was selected as a common behaviour at moments of environmental or population stress. However, as soon as Neanderthals had to compete with another species that consumed the same resources (AMHS in this case) cannibalism had a negative impact, leading, in the end, to their extinction. To test this hypothesis, we used an agent-based model computer simulation. The model is simple, with only traits, behaviours and landscape features defined and with no attempt to re-create the exact landscape in which Neanderthals lived or their cultural characteristics. The basic agent of our system is a group of individuals that form a community. The most important state variable of our model is the location of the group, coupled with a defined home range and two additional factors: cannibalism and the chance of fission. The result of the simulation shows that cannibalistic behaviour is always selected when resources are scarce and clustered. However, when a non-cannibalistic species (late Pleistocene AMHS) is introduced into the same environment, the cannibalistic species retreats and the new species grows until it has reached the carrying capacity of the system. The cannibalistic populations that still survive are displaced from the richest areas, and live on the borders with arid zones, a situation which is remarkably similar to what we know about the end of the Neanderthals.},

The distribution of the Campanian Ignimbrite has been enhanced by the discovery of cryptotephra deposits (volcanic ash layers that are not visible to the naked eye) in archaeological cave sequences. They enable us to synchronize archaeological and paleoclimatic records through the period of transition from Neanderthal to the earliest anatomically modern human populations in Europe. Our results confirm that the combined effects of a major volcanic eruption and severe climatic cooling failed to have lasting impacts on Neanderthals or early modern humans in Europe.

This genomic information, coupled with diversity exome data from several Neanderthal specimens is shedding new light on evolutionary processes such as the genetic basis of Neanderthal and modern human-specific adaptations—including morphological and behavioural traits—as well as the extent and nature of the admixture events between them. An emerging picture is that Neanderthals had a long-term small population size, lived in small and isolated groups and probably practised inbreeding at times. Deleterious genetic effects associated with these demographic factors could have played a role in their extinction. The analysis of DNA from further remains making use of new large-scale hybridization-capture-based methods as well as of new approaches to discriminate contaminant DNA sequences will provide genetic information in spatial and temporal scales that could help clarify the Neanderthal's—and our very own—evolutionary history.},

The many potential problems affecting accuracy of this technique are discussed as a caveat as to what one might expect of future research and development in this field. The main aim of the paper, however, is to examine exactly what our chronological precision is in the period 30–40 ka BP, i.e. at around five to seven half lives of radiocarbon. If mathematical models of Neanderthal extinction are correct, the whole process could have occurred within the error of one radiocarbon date at two standard deviations, which does not bode well for understanding what must have been a complex set of processes. The assumptions made by palaeoanthropologists working with this problem are discussed, particularly in relation to how dates are actually used, and how sedimentology affects chronology. These problems aside, a coarse and necessarily provisional attempt to interpret the existing archaeological database is made, with the assumption that Late Middle Palaeolithic and ‘transitional’ industries are proxy indicators of Neanderthal presence in a region. From this, it is suggested that the processes of Neanderthal extinction began by c. 40 ka BP in the Balkans and Central Europe, radiating out from there, leaving Neanderthals on the periphery of their old distribution (southern Iberia, southern Italy, Crimea, Siberia, and one might predict the United Kingdom) as late as c. 29 ka BP. The processes differ in signature (and therefore by extension nature and quite possibly cause) region to region, and because of this, the role of anatomically modern humans in the extinction of Neanderthals is questioned.},

Until relatively recently, conclusions about the relationships between Neanderthals and contemporary humans were based solely upon evidence left behind in the fossil and archaeological records. However, in the last decade, we have witnessed the introduction of metagenomic analyses, which have provided novel tools with which to study the levels of genetic interactions between this fascinating Homo lineage and modern humans. Were Neanderthals replaced by contemporary humans through dramatic extinction resulting from competition and/or hostility or through admixture? Were Neanderthals and modern humans two independent, genetically unique species or were they a single species, capable of producing fertile offspring?

The Neanderthals were a Eurasian human species of the genus Homo that disappeared approximately 30,000 years ago. The cause or causes of their extinction continues to intrigue specialists and non-specialists alike. Here a contributory role for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) is suggested. TSEs could have infected Neanderthal groups as a result of general cannibalistic activity and brain tissue consumption in particular. Further infection could then have taken place through continued cannibalistic activity or via shared used of infected stone tools. A modern human hunter-gatherer proxy has been developed and applied as a hypothetical model to the Neanderthals. This hypothesis suggests that the impact of TSEs on the Neanderthals could have been dramatic and have played a large part in contributing to the processes of Neanderthal extinction.},

More broadly based economies emerged first in the early Upper Paleolithic in the eastern Mediterranean region and later in the rest of Eurasia.

A number of these regions are associated with response to infection and immunity, with a suggestion that derived Neanderthal alleles found in modern Europeans and East Asians may be associated with autoimmunity. As such Neanderthal genomes are an independent line of evidence of which infectious diseases Neanderthals were genetically adapted to. Sympathetically, human genome adaptive introgression is an independent line of evidence of which infectious diseases were important for AMH coming in to Eurasia and interacting with Neanderthals. The Neanderthals and Denisovans present interesting cases of hominin hunter-gatherers adapted to a Eurasian rather than African infectious disease package. Independent sources of DNA-based evidence allow a re-evaluation of the first epidemiologic transition and how infectious disease affected Pleistocene hominins. By combining skeletal, archaeological and genetic evidence from modern humans and extinct Eurasian hominins, we question whether the first epidemiologic transition in Eurasia featured a new package of infectious diseases or a change in the impact of existing pathogens. Coupled with pathogen genomics, this approach supports the view that many infectious diseases are pre-Neolithic, and the list continues to expand. The transfer of pathogens between hominin populations, including the expansion of pathogens from Africa, may also have played a role in the extinction of the Neanderthals and offers an important mechanism to understand hominin–hominin interactions well back beyond the current limits for aDNA extraction from fossils alone.

Better resolution can be obtained by dating individual artifacts. Luminescence dates for 67 ceramics from several sites in the mid-South show variation in age of ceramics from a single assemblage, strong chronological overlap between shell- and grog-tempered pottery, and suggest that shell-tempered pottery may have been present in low frequencies earlier than generally assumed and before it rose in frequency sometime after A.D. 900. /// Nuestro conocimiento sobre la cronología de cerámica con desgrasante de concha del Este de los Estados Unidos es pobre, impidiendo que podamos resolver de forma adecuada la cuestión sobre el por qué este tipo de cerámica dominó los inventarios característicos del último periodo prehistórico.

	abstract = {Frequency seriation played a key role in the formation of archaeology as a discipline due to its ability to generate chronologies. Interest in its utility for exploring issues of contemporary interest beyond chronology, however, has been limited. This limitation is partly due to a lack of quantitative algorithms that can be used to build deterministic seriation solutions. When the number of assemblages becomes greater than just a handful, the resources required for evaluation of possible permutations easily outstrips available computing capacity. On the other hand, probabilistic approaches to creating seriations offer a computationally manageable alternative but rely upon a compressed description of the data to order assemblages. This compression removes the ability to use all of the features of our data to fit to the seriation model, obscuring violations of the model, and thus lessens our ability to understand the degree to which the resulting order is chronological, spatial, or a mixture. Recently, frequency seriation has been reconceived as a general method for studying the structure of cultural transmission through time and across space. The use of an evolution-based framework renews the potential for seriation but also calls for a computationally feasible algorithm that is capable of producing solutions under varying configurations, without manual trial and error fitting. Here, we introduce the Iterative Deterministic Seriation Solution (IDSS) for constructing frequency seriations, an algorithm that dramatically constrains the search for potential valid orders of assemblages. Our initial implementation of IDSS does not solve all the problems of seriation, but begins to moves towards a resolution of a long-standing problem in archaeology while opening up new avenues of research into the study of cultural relatedness. We demonstrate the utility of IDSS using late prehistoric decorated ceramics from the Mississippi River Valley. The results compare favorably to previous analyses but add new details into the structure of cultural transmission of these late prehistoric populations.},

From this examination it is concluded that seriations may be inferred to be chronologies when and only when: (1) the comparisons are conducted using historical classes; (2) the units ordered are of comparable duration; (3) the units ordered are from the same cultural tradition; and (4) when the order is repeated through several independent seriations. The means of assessing whether or not a given seriation meets these conditions is considered in detail.

The human remains are securely dated by U-series on overlying flowstones and a rich associated faunal sample to the initial Late Pleistocene, {\textgreater}100 kya. As such, they are the oldest modern human fossils in East Asia and predate by {\textgreater}60,000 y the oldest previously known modern human remains in the region. The Zhiren 3 mandible in particular presents derived modern human anterior symphyseal morphology, with a projecting tuber symphyseos, distinct mental fossae, modest lateral tubercles, and a vertical symphysis; it is separate from any known late archaic human mandible. However, it also exhibits a lingual symphyseal morphology and corpus robustness that place it close to later Pleistocene archaic humans. The age and morphology of the Zhiren Cave human remains support a modern human emergence scenario for East Asia involving dispersal with assimilation or populational continuity with gene flow. It also places the Late Pleistocene Asian emergence of modern humans in a pre-Upper Paleolithic context and raises issues concerning the long-term Late Pleistocene coexistence of late archaic and early modern humans across Eurasia.},

The skullcap seems to share also some features with Neanderthals that can be observed on the lower part of the frontal bone and in the nasal and orbital region such as a supratoral sulcus, a prominent glabella, prominent rounded lateral supraorbital margins, and a well-defined inward nasion. The comparison of the dimensions of the skullcap with those of skullcaps of a reference sample by multidimensional scaling analysis shows similarities with Neanderthals, Chinese Homo erectus, and West/Far East archaic Homo sapiens. However, the too fragmentary condition of the fossil does not allow any further comparison.

The diaphyses of the specimen are compared with recent human and archaicHomojuveniles using cross-sectional geometric parameters (areas and second moments of area obtained through external molding and multiple plane radiography) to assess axial and bending strengths. Despite an incipient femoral pilaster (not seen in archaicHomobut predominant among early modern humans), the Yamashita-cho 1 femoral and tibial midshafts fall close to the archaic humans and at the limits of recent human variation in terms of diaphyseal cross-sectional shape [Ix/Iy, Imax/Imin, \% cortical area (CA)] and robusticity [CA-STD and polar second moment of area (J)-STD]. In contrast, the Yamashita-cho 1 femoral neck-shaft angle of 136° and its predicted adult value of ca.132° place it well above those of archaicHomo, and close to the values for African, Near Eastern and more recent eastern Asian early modern humans. In this respect, Yamashita-cho 1 is aligned with early modern humans. These data provide a mosaic pattern, in which diaphyseal robusticity and the cross-sectional distribution of bone parallel those seen in archaicHomo, whereas the presence of an incipient pilaster and the high neck-shaft angle align the specimen with early modern humans. Given that most of these features are developmentally plastic, these imply a changing ontogenetic pattern of lower-limb loading regimes in eastern Asia associated with the emergence of modern humans.},

It also outlines the extinctions and immigration of land mammals during the periods.  In Hokkaido, the fauna of the last glacial period is represented only by a few extinct large mammal species.  It is inferred that the Mammoth Fauna immigrated from eastern Siberia into Hokkaido during this period.  The large mammal species of the last glacial period became extinct possibly by the beginning of the Holocene.  The Holocene fauna of Hokkaido is almost idenfical with its present-day fauna, and no mammals immigrated into Hokkaido during the Holocene.  In Honshu-Shikoku-Kyushu, the last glacial fauna is predominated by extant species now distributed in this region, and contains several extinct species as well as several extant species now exotic to this region.  The extinct and exotic species seem to have become extinct between ca. 20,000 and ca. 10,000yrsBP in radiocarbon age.  During the last glacial period, few elements of the Mammoth Fauna immigrated into Honshu-Shikoku-Kyushu from Hokkaido.  Such limited immigration is inferred to have occurred through temporary ice bridges formed across the Tsugaru Stait instead of a stable land bridge.  In Honshu-Shikoku-Kyushu, the Holocene fauna is almost identical with the present-day fauna, and no mammals immigrated into this region during the Holocene.  In the Ryukyu Islands, the last glacial fauna is of insular type, and its main elements including middle- and small-sized deer became extinct possibly by the beginning of the Holocene.

We show here that this “pre-Toba” dispersal model is in serious conflict with both the most recent genetic evidence from both Africa and Asia and the archaeological evidence from South Asian sites. We present an alternative model based on a combination of genetic analyses and recent archaeological evidence from South Asia and Africa. These data support a coastally oriented dispersal of modern humans from eastern Africa to southern Asia ∼60–50 thousand years ago (ka). This was associated with distinctively African microlithic and “backed-segment” technologies analogous to the African “Howiesons Poort” and related technologies, together with a range of distinctively “modern” cultural and symbolic features (highly shaped bone tools, personal ornaments, abstract artistic motifs, microblade technology, etc.), similar to those that accompanied the replacement of “archaic” Neanderthal by anatomically modern human populations in other regions of western Eurasia at a broadly similar date.},

	abstract = {Although fossil remains show that anatomically modern humans dispersed out of Africa into the Near East ∼100 to 130 ka, genetic evidence from extant populations has suggested that non-Africans descend primarily from a single successful later migration. Within the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) tree, haplogroup L3 encompasses not only many sub-Saharan Africans but also all ancient non-African lineages, and its age therefore provides an upper bound for the dispersal out of Africa. An analysis of 369 complete African L3 sequences places this maximum at ∼70 ka, virtually ruling out a successful exit before 74 ka, the date of the Toba volcanic supereruption in Sumatra. The similarity of the age of L3 to its two non-African daughter haplogroups, M and N, suggests that the same process was likely responsible for both the L3 expansion in Eastern Africa and the dispersal of a small group of modern humans out of Africa to settle the rest of the world. The timing of the expansion of L3 suggests a link to improved climatic conditions after ∼70 ka in Eastern and Central Africa rather than to symbolically mediated behavior, which evidently arose considerably earlier. The L3 mtDNA pool within Africa suggests a migration from Eastern Africa to Central Africa ∼60 to 35 ka and major migrations in the immediate postglacial again linked to climate. The largest population size increase seen in the L3 data is 3–4 ka in Central Africa, corresponding to Bantu expansions, leading diverse L3 lineages to spread into Eastern and Southern Africa in the last 3–2 ka.},

We then examine the paleoenvironmental and, particularly, archaeological records for this time period and note that this putative demographic event coincides with a period of ecological and technological change in South Asia. We document the development of a new diminutive stone blade (microlithic) technology beginning at 35–30 ka, the first time that the precocity of this transition has been recognized across the subcontinent. We argue that the transition to microlithic technology may relate to changes in subsistence practices, as increasingly large and probably fragmented populations exploited resources in contracting favorable ecological zones just before the onset of full glacial conditions.},

	abstract = {Hominins living in southern India 74,000 years ago faced a deteriorating environment, as the global climate moved from interglacial into full glacial conditions. At the same time, South Asian populations witnessed the widespread deposition of tephra from the Sumatran Toba super-eruption, the largest explosive volcanic event of the past two million years. Here we report new data on the lithic technology and environmental context for a southern Indian site with hominin occupation in association with Toba tephra deposits: Jwalapuram Locality 3 in the Jurreru Valley. Sedimentological and isotopic studies demonstrate that a cooling trend was in effect in this part of southern India prior to the eruption, and that thick deposits of ash in the Jurreru Valley supported grassland communities before more wooded conditions were re-established. Detailed technological analyses of an expanded lithic sample from Locality 3 suggest cultural continuity after the eruptive event, and comparisons with lithic core technologies elsewhere indicate that Homo sapiens cannot be ruled out as the creator of these Middle Palaeolithic assemblages.},

	abstract = {The dispersal of Homo sapiens out of Africa is a significant topic in human evolutionary studies. Most investigators agree that our species arose in Africa and subsequently spread out to occupy much of Eurasia. Researchers have argued that populations expanded along the Indian Ocean rim at ca 60 000 years ago during a single rapid dispersal event, probably employing a coastal route towards Australasia. Archaeologists have been relatively silent about the movement and expansion of human populations in terrestrial environments along the Indian Ocean rim, although it is clear that Homo sapiens reached Australia by ca 45 000 years ago. Here, we synthesize and document current genetic and archaeological evidence from two major landmasses, the Arabian peninsula and the Indian subcontinent, regions that have been underplayed in the story of out of Africa dispersals. We suggest that modern humans were present in Arabia and South Asia earlier than currently believed, and probably coincident with the presence of Homo sapiens in the Levant between ca 130 and 70 000 years ago. We show that climatic and environmental fluctuations during the Late Pleistocene would have had significant demographic effects on Arabian and South Asian populations, though indigenous populations would have responded in different ways. Based on a review of the current genetic, archaeological and environmental data, we indicate that demographic patterns in Arabia and South Asia are more interesting and complex than surmised to date.},

Traditionally, interpretations have drawn mainly on evidence from the many large and well‐known sites in Europe, but archaeological research in Africa and the Levant is increasingly altering and elaborating upon our understanding of later human evolution. Despite the presence of a number of important early modern human and other hominin sites in Southeast Asia, evidence from this region has not contributed to the global picture in any significant way. Indeed, the acknowledged simplicity of lithic assemblages has led generations of scholars to assume that Southeast Asia was far from the cutting edge of behavioural evolution. Comparison of sophisticated shell tools from levels dated to 32,000–28,000 b.p. in eastern Indonesia with lithic artefacts recovered from the same levels and an assessment of raw‐material procurement suggest that using lithic technologies as markers of behavioural complexity may be misleading in a Southeast Asian context and, indeed, may be hampering our efforts to assess behavioural complexity in global and comparative frameworks.},

Although genetic and archeological data indicate a rapid migration out of Africa and into Southeast Asia by at least 60 ka, mainland Southeast Asia is notable for its absence of fossil evidence for early modern human occupation. Here we report on a modern human cranium from Tam Pa Ling, Laos, which was recovered from a secure stratigraphic context. Radiocarbon and luminescence dating of the surrounding sediments provide a minimum age of 51–46 ka, and direct U-dating of the bone indicates a maximum age of ∼63 ka. The cranium has a derived modern human morphology in features of the frontal, occipital, maxillae, and dentition. It is also differentiated from western Eurasian archaic humans in aspects of its temporal, occipital, and dental morphology. In the context of an increasingly documented archaic–modern morphological mosaic among the earliest modern humans in western Eurasia, Tam Pa Ling establishes a definitively modern population in Southeast Asia at ∼50 ka cal BP. As such, it provides the earliest skeletal evidence for fully modern humans in mainland Southeast Asia.},

It has special global significance for its record of early pelagic fishing and ancient shell fish hooks. It is also of regional significance for its early occupation and comparatively large assemblage of Pleistocene stone artefacts. Three major findings arise from our study of the stone artefacts. First, there is little change in lithic technology over the 42,000 year sequence, with the most noticeable change being the addition of new artefact types and raw materials in the mid-Holocene. Second, the assemblage is dominated by small chert cores and implements rather than pebble tools and choppers, a pattern we argue pattern, we argue, that is common in island SE Asian sites as opposed to mainland SE Asian sites. Third, the Jerimalai assemblage bears a striking resemblance to the assemblage from Liang Bua, argued by the Liang Bua excavation team to be associated with Homo floresiensis. We argue that the near proximity of these two islands along the Indonesian island chain (c.100 km apart), the long antiquity of modern human occupation in the region (as documented at Jerimalai), and the strong resemblance of distinctive flake stone technologies seen at both sites, raises the intriguing possibility that both the Liang Bua and Jerimalai assemblages were created by modern humans.},

	abstract = {Analyses of microblade industries shed light on the human dispersal and technological diffusion in the terminal Upper Paleolithic of East Asia. From ca. 27–17 ka, with the advances of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Mammoth Steppe and its associated mammoth fauna shifted southward. In the wake of these changes, human groups with the Northern Microblade Industries (NMI) also migrated southward to Northeast China. NMI did not appear in North China, so it is presumed that those migrating human groups did not extend their activity areas beyond NE China. Meanwhile, the human groups with small flake tool industries in North China appear to have interacted with those groups with NMI at the ecological border area between NE. China and N. China, and obtained the microblade technology of pressure flaking, wedge-shaped micro-cores, transverse burins with marginal retouch and other elements of NMI, leading to the formation of the microblade industries that are unique to N. China. Technological elements of the NMI that appeared in N. China are regarded as the result of external expansion diffusion. Among the distinct features of the microblade industries in N. China is the microblade technology based on pyramidal micro-cores. This technology was transferred to Southwest Japan. This transfer of microblade technology and its spread across SW Japan was carried out through the materials and information exchange network that had connected N. China and SW Japan since the pre-stage of microblade industry. This diffusion of microblade technology is also regard as an example of external expansion diffusion. From ca. 17–9 ka, human groups that were migrating with NMI through NE China were able to enter N. China because of their flexible “collector” subsistence strategy and high level of adaptability to the environment. The appearance of NMI in N. China is regard as the result of external relocation diffusion. The technological transfer also occurred between the migrating human groups and the indigenous groups. The indigenous ones in turn adopted the technology of NMI, invented small bifacial points. This process is an example of expansion diffusion.},

This has often been explained as the result of an indigenous development. However, the ‘heterogenic’ character of Upper Paleolithic industries is the result of the continuing influx of modern human populations via two different routes: (1) from Siberia and (2) from southern China. Blade technology from Siberia appeared in the Korean peninsula around 35 000 BP and coexisted with core and flake stone industries carried by modern humans from southern China and Southeast Asia throughout the Upper Paleolithic. This explanation is based on the current observation of patterns of Upper Paleolithic industries in East Asia. Blade industries have been found only in the northern part of East Asia while none have been reported in southern China, although modern Homo evidently dispersed via two different routes from the Near East. The ‘North-South Model’ of Modern Homo migrations into the Korean peninsula is supported by a genetic analysis of the Y-chromosome of the modern population in this region. Continuing influx of modern human population from both origins to the peninsula can explain the consistent presence of Upper Paleolithic industries that appear heterogenic.},

Gonzalez   Darren Modzelewski   Lee M. Panich   Tsim D. Schneider   Angela Cavender Wilson's 2004 essay "Reclaiming Our Humanity: Decolonization and the Recovery of Indigenous Knowledge" provides a useful starting point for considering the role of decolonization in both the academy and in our everyday lives.1 Wilson, as an Indigenous scholar, muses, "For what had I been continually seeking an education if not to transform the world around me and create a place where justice for Indigenous people is more than an illusion?"2 For Wilson, the writings of Frantz Fanon and Paulo Freire concerning respectively decolonization and praxis provided, as she says, "the language to articulate [her] own struggle."3 Decolonization as Wilson applies it refers to the process of reversing the colonial structures inherent in both the institutions of colonialism and in the minds of the colonized. In relation to the decolonization of Indigenous peoples, Wilson stresses that Indigenous communities must return to their traditions, reassert these traditional cultural and social values and worldviews into their everyday lives, and begin to rebuild their communities accordingly. But it is through praxis, theoretically informed action, that people are able to decolonize themselves and the structures around them. The concept of praxis situates the power of people, as thinking and knowing individuals, to reflect upon their lives and change them through their actions. For us, four graduate students from mixed backgrounds, the appeal of decolonization lies in our individualized backgrounds as well as in our own desire to make our research matter.

Over the course of a month-long field school sponsored by the University of California, Berkeley, we—Sara Gonzalez, Darren Modzelewski, Lee Panich, and Tsim Schneider—served as graduate student instructors and each led a crew of four undergraduate students. Archaeological field schools are designed to provide undergraduates with hands-on training in archaeological methods and practice. The 2004 summer field program, the Kashaya [End Page 389] Pomo Interpretive Trail Project (KPITP), is an extension of the Fort Ross Archaeological Project (FRAP). Both are collaborative projects involving UC Berkeley, the California Department of Parks and Recreation, and the Kashaya Pomo tribe. This project is codirected by Kent Lightfoot, professor of anthropology at UC Berkeley, and Otis Parrish (Kashaya Pomo), cultural attaché at the Hearst Museum of Anthropology. Project associates include Roberta Jewett, director of archaeological operations, and Breck Parkman, who coordinates the project for California State Parks. For the past fifteen years FRAP has researched the multi-ethnic colony of Fort Ross and has attempted to study the long-term effects of mercantile colonialism upon the colony's workers and laborers, as well as upon Native Californians within the region.4 The current project attempts to integrate the results of the research and present this information to the broader public through the creation of a walkable interpretive trail within Fort Ross State Historic Park. The project itself did not self-consciously attempt to decolonize archaeology, but from our vantage point, the Kashaya Pomo Interpretive Trail Project and summer field school contributed to these goals through the operation of the field school, implementation of archaeological methods, and the ongoing process of collaboration with Kashaya Pomo tribal elders and council members. In this article we will address how each aspect of the project has contributed to a form of scholarship that attempts to blend Kashaya ceremony with the science of archaeology. Kashaya...},

	abstract = {As federally and non-federally recognized tribal communities assert control over the management of tribal heritage, there is a significant opportunity to work with these nations to further refine and develop approaches to archaeological practice that work for the long-term care and protection of tribal heritage. This article evaluates the methodological implications of integrating indigenous values and cultural protocols into archaeological practice and tribal historic preservation. Drawing upon the example of the Kashaya Pomo Interpretive Trail Project at Fort Ross State Historic Park, I examine how respectful, engaged, community-based dialogue with the Kashia Band of Pomo Indians led to the development of a low-impact archaeological methodology that contributes to the capacity of the Kashia Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO) to employ archaeology as a tool of historic preservation. Although this methodology was developed with specific reference to the needs and cultural protocols of the Kashaya Pomo, it provides a salient model of a sovereignty-based approach to tribal historic preservation that may be relevant to other tribal heritage managers. The application of a suite of low-impact survey methods, including the catch-and-release surface collection strategy, also provides tribal and non-tribal heritage professionals with additional tools for recovering data from cultural resources with minimal impact. Spanish A medida que las comunidades tribales, tanto las reconocidas federalmente como las que no lo están, reivindican su derecho para ejercer el control sobre la gestión de su patrimonio cultural, se presenta una gran oportunidad de trabajo con dichas naciones para desarrollar y refinar estrategias de práctica arqueológica que resulten efectivas para una mejor protección y conservación del patrimonio tribal a largo plazo. Este artículo evalúa las implicaciones metodológicas derivadas de la integración de los valores y protocolos culturales indígenas en la práctica arqueológica y en la preservación de su patrimonio histórico. Basándonos en el ejemplo del proyecto Kashaya Pomo Interpretative Trail desarrollado en el parque histórico estatal de Fort Ross, examinamos cómo el trabajo basado en el compromiso, el respeto y el diálogo con la comunidad Kashia de indígenas Pomo ha permitido desarrollar un método arqueológico de mínimo impacto que contribuye con la capacidad de la oficina de conservación de historia tribal de los Kashia Tribal Historic Preservation Office, (THPO por sus siglas en inglés) para favorecer el uso de la arqueología como herramienta para la conservación histórica. A pesar de que el método presentado en este trabajo fue desarrollado en base a las necesidades específicas y protocolos culturales de los Kashaya Pomo, éste proporciona un modelo destacado de acercamiento a la conservación histórica indígena basado en la soberanía de los pueblos. Dicho modelo puede resultar de interés para otros gestores del patrimonio cultural tribal y oficinas de gestión del patrimonio (THPOs). La aplicación de una serie de métodos de prospección de bajo impacto, incluyendo la estrategia de prospección en superficie sin recojo de materiales, proporciona además herramientas metodológicas adicionales para la recopilación de datos sobre recursos culturales con un impacto mínimo, las cuales pueden ser de interés tanto para los profesionales del patrimonio tribal como para el resto.},

	abstract = {Ethnoarchaeology appears nowadays as a poorly formulated field. However, it could become a real science of reference for interpreting the past if it was focused upon well-founded cross-cultural correlates, linking material culture with static and dynamic phenomena. For this purpose, such correlates have to be studied in terms of explanatory mechanisms. Cross-cultural correlates correspond to those regularities where explanatory mechanisms invoke universals. These universals can be studied by reference to the theories found in the different disciplines they relate to and which are situated outside of the domain of archaeology. In the domain of technology, cross-cultural correlates cover a wide range of static and dynamic phenomena. They allow the archaeologist to interpret archaeological facts—for which there is not necessarily analogue—in terms of local historical scenario as well as cultural evolution. In this respect, it is shown that ethnoarchaeology, when following appropriate methodologies and focussing on the universals that underlie the diversity of archaeological facts, does provide the reference data needed to climb up in the pyramid of inferences that make up our interpretative constructs.},

Practitioners hope to establish consistent links between the two that can be used to interpret archaeological evidence of human behavior in the past. Much of this work is descriptive: analysts seldom attempt to explain variation in the behavior they observe, instead simply documenting its archaeological implications. This limits the utility of their results. At best, they can only identify the past distribution of ethnographically known behavior. Evidence of anything else is uninterpretable; the behavioral variability it reflects inexplicable. This problem can be resolved only by linking ethnoarchaeology with a general theory of behavior. Neo-Darwinian behavioral ecology may provide the necessary framework. Recent ethnoarchaeological work on site structure and faunal remains, especially as applied in research on the Paleolithic, illustrates both the problem and the appeal of the proposed solution.},

With never before published data from the Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project, we analyze the relationship between household rice farming and pottery exchange in Dangtalan from 1975 to 1976. We show that inequalities in rice landholdings and yields were ameliorated through household exchange of pottery. Households with the highest rice productivities (rice yield divided by field area) received pots from households with lower productivities. There is a clear inverse relationship between household investment in rice farming and ceramic exchange to other community households. By tracing out the exchange networks, we find that village divisions have influence on who exchanges with whom. The fact that women manage a household’s pottery production and rice farming and that village divisions play a role in the socialization of young men suggests that subsistence and craft production cross-cut gendered cultural traditions. This pattern may be the product of a complex-adaptive system undergoing change.},

Such allometric variation (change in proportion as a function of change in size) is useful to estimate the degree of reduction that tools experienced. Reduction itself is a measure of curation, a theoretical concept of great interest in lithic studies and Paleolithic archaeology. To determine the reduction that archaeological tools experienced, we must compare their size and proportions at first use to the same properties at discard that we directly measure. By now many size estimates can be made from discarded tools. Some are experimentally tested but few are validated using direct ethnoarchaeological controls. We validate two allometric reduction measures—ratios of plan area to thickness and of an estimate of original to discarded volume—against direct measures of use and reduction in ethnographic Gamo hidescrapers from Ethiopia.},

I argue that lithic ethnoarchaeology would benefit from a comparative organizational framework for explaining variation in patterns of stone tool use that takes into account the predictability and redundancy of the location and timing of technological activities. Understanding the underlying causes of modern patterns of stone tool use, in turn, offers a framework for exploring sources of lithic technological variation in the archaeological record.

When studying archaeological sites in tropical environments, such as rainforests, one must take into account and study the role of the tropics in the formation of the archaeological record. Human adaptation to tropical environment influences people's practices, use of space and materiality. In addition, the environmental setting plays a significant role in post-depositional processes which may alter, preserve or disrupt archaeological materials. This study involve a long term ethnographic research among a contemporary forager group in South India, which allowed us to associate the social aspects of forager ways of living – such as mobility, immediacy and adaptation to the tropical forest - with patterns of use of apace and material deposition. Excavations of an abandoned open-air site and a rock-shelter of the same group, included field observations and sediment sampling followed by laboratory analyses which enabled the investigation of post-depositional processes at both the visible and invisible (microscopic and sub-microscopic) scales. Overall, although forager ways of living and the environmental conditions in tropical forests challenge the formation of a well preserved archaeological evidence, an integrated approach examining the different scales of the archaeological record can successfully reconstruct the formation processes of archaeological sites in tropical forests and associate the archaeological evidence with social aspects of forager ways of living.},

We address these issues by focusing on the space in which researchers operate, namely the ‘gap’ between archaeological and Indigenous conceptualizations of the world, and propose methodological openness to help achieve new ways of thinking about ethnoarchaeology. Drawing on our experiences conducting rock art research in Australia and the American Southwest, we describe the complexities that emerged during conversations with Yanyuwa and Zuni elders and how they have helped bridge the methodological ‘gap’ and enrich our research and understanding of rock art.},

Vagueness and vague experiences can structure material categorisations of the world; it can contribute to the shaping of social relations and nurture the appreciation of difficult experiences. However, the recent archaeological (re)turn to science as the main provider of knowledge of the past renders vagueness futile as an empirical occurrence through its exorcism of elusiveness and ambiguity in the notorious pursuit of absolute, exact and quantifiable facts. This article challenges the pursuit and use of exact data in archaeological science and the consequential implications of the omission of vague occurrences, discussing the problem that ambiguous and absent evidence become neglected in subsequent conclusion. Second, it is demonstrated that vagueness and ambiguity can be integral to certain social and material phenomena. Third, the article examines recent archaeological analyses of burial practices in South Scandinavian passage graves from the Middle Neolithic in order to discuss the pursuit of certitude in archaeological observations and interpretations. Finally, it is argued that the idealisation of certitude in archaeological analysis needs to be complemented by an interpretative framework making it possible to recognise vagueness as a social phenomenon.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a study that sheds light on an issue that is important for understanding human behavioral evolution—the factors that influence hunter-gatherers’ decisions regarding the number and degree of specialization of their tools. Two primary drivers of technological richness and complexity have been proposed in the anthropological literature: population size and environmental risk. In general, ethnographic studies tend to support environmental risk as the primary driver, whereas the limited number of archaeological studies that have been carried out seem to support population size. These findings are difficult to reconcile because problems exist for both sets of studies. The present study was designed with these problems in mind. We used an archaeological dataset to test which of the hypothesized driving factors—population size or environmental risk—best explains changes in technological richness. More specifically, we investigated whether changes in the number of point types in Texas from the first occupation more than 13,000 years ago to the Late Prehistoric period, around 400 years ago, are better explained by environmental risk or by population size. Bivariate correlations and a generalized linear model indicate that temporal changes in point-type richness in Texas are significantly associated with changes in one of our proxies of risk—global temperature. We found no relationship between temporal changes in point-type richness and changes in population size. Thus, the results derived from this study are consistent with the environmental risk hypothesis and inconsistent with the population size hypothesis.},

Several modeling studies support the idea that population size can affect cultural evolution, but the results of empirical studies are ambiguous. Here we report a study that used tool kit data from recent hunter-gatherers, in conjunction with correlation analysis and a global sample, a continental sample, and a regional sample. The results of the analyses do not support the hypothesis. Population size was correlated with some tool kit variables in the global sample, but these relationships disappeared when two factors that have previously been found to affect hunter-gatherer tool kits—risk of resource failure and mobility—were controlled for. Population size was not correlated with the tool kit variables in the other samples. The regression analyses also did not support the population size hypothesis. Together, these results challenge the use of population size to explain patterns in the Paleolithic archaeological record. Population size may explain some of the patterns in question, but this needs to be demonstrated through tests in which the population size hypothesis is explicitly pitted against competing hypotheses, such as adaptation to shifting ecological conditions.},

	abstract = {Variation in subsistence-related material culture is an important aspect of the archaeological and ethnographic records, but the factors that are responsible for it remain unclear. Here, we examine this issue by evaluating four factors that may affect the diversity and complexity of the food-getting tools employed by hunter-gatherer populations: 1) the nature of the food resources; 2) risk of resource failure; 3) residential mobility; and 4) population size. We apply step-wise multiple regression analysis to technological and ecological data for 20 hunter-gatherer populations from several regions of the world. The analyses support the hypothesis that risk of resource failure has a significant impact on toolkit diversity and complexity. The results do not support the hypothesis that the characteristics of the resources exploited for food influence toolkit structure, or that residential mobility affects toolkit diversity and complexity. They are also not in line with the hypothesis that population size has an impact on toolkit structure. While our analyses appear to strongly support the suggestion that resource failure risk is the primary influence on hunter-gatherer toolkit structure, we argue that it would be premature to discount the other factors at this stage, and outline the steps that we believe need to be taken next. Malgré le fait qu'il s'agisse d'un aspect important de l'archéologie et de l'ethnologie, les facteurs responsables du changement de la culture matérielle relié à la subsistance sont encore mal connus. Nous examinons quatre facteurs qui pourraient affecter la diversité et la complexité de l'outillage de subsistance des chasseurs-cueilleurs: 1) la nature des ressources alimentaires exploitées; 2) l'éventualité de manquer de ressources; 3) la mobilité résidentielle et 4) la taille de la population. Nous utilisons la régression multiple pour analyser les données technologiques et de subsistance de 20 populations de chasseurs-cueilleurs de diverses régions du monde. Les résultats de nos analyses n'appuient pas l'hypothèse selon laquelle les caractéristiques des ressources exploitées influencent significativement la diversité et la complexité des outillages, pas plus celle soulignant l'impact d'un mode d'établissement de type « mobilité résidentielle » ou encore celle arguant pour l'important rôle de la taille de la population. Alors que nos données montrent surtout que la structure de la composition de l'outillage est plutôt influencée par le facteur du risque d'échec, nous suggérons cependant qu'il est encore prématuré de rejeter ces trois derniers facteurs et nous proposons des avenues de recherche additionnelles.},

However, the risk proxies and samples employed in these studies are potentially problematic. With this in mind, we retested the risk hypothesis with data from hunter–gatherer populations who lived in the northwest coast and plateau regions of the Pacific Northwest during the early contact period. We focused on these populations partly because the northwest coast and plateau differ in ways that can be expected to lead to differences in risk, and partly because of the availability of data for a wide range of risk-relevant variables. Our analyses suggest that the plateau was a more risky environment than the northwest coast. However, the predicted differences in the number and complexity of the populations' subsistence tools were not observed. The discrepancy between our results and those of previous tests of the risk hypothesis is not due to methodological differences. Rather, it seems to reflect an important but hitherto unappreciated feature of the relationship between risk and toolkit structure, namely that the impact of risk is dependent on the scale of the risk differences among populations.},

Statistical analysis of these points demonstrates that 80\% of the variation in metrical attributes (e.g., length, width) is accounted for by the mean of the attribute, suggesting that this variation is independent of the transmission process and primarily due to production in which error tolerances are relative, not absolute. The remaining variation, specifically, metrical variability that is substantially greater or less than normally occurs as a consequence of these relative production tolerances, is only partly consistent with transmission theory expectations. More complex point shapes show less metrical variation than simple forms, and arrow points show less metrical variation than dart points, as predicted. There is substantial variation by section, point type, and measurement, however, that remains unexplained by the transmission hypothesis.},

The point typology most widely employed in the Great Basin before about 1980 (the Berkeley typology) uses weight to distinguish larger dart points from smaller, but similarly shaped, arrow points. The typology commonly used today (the Monitor typology) uses basal width to distinguish wide-based dart points from narrow-based arrow points. The two typologies are in general agreement except in central Nevada, where some dart points are light, hence incorrectly typed by the Berkeley typology, and in eastern California, where some arrow points are wide-based, hence incorrectly typed by the Monitor typology. Scarce raw materials and resharpening may explain why dart points are sometimes light in central Nevada. That arrow point basal width is more variable in eastern California than central Nevada likely reflects differences in the cultural processes attending the spread and subsequent maintenance of bow-and-arrow technology in these two localities.},

Related to this problem is the absence of a robust statistical technique for comparing variation between different kinds of assemblages. This paper addresses these issues. The Weber fraction for line-length estimation describes the minimum difference that humans can perceive through unaided visual inspection. This value is used to derive a constant for the coefficient of variation (CV = 1.7 percent) that represents the highest degree of standardization attainable through manual human production of artifacts. Random data are used to define a second constant for the coefficient of variation that represents variation expected when production is random (CV = 57.7 percent). These two constants can be used to assess the degree of standardization in artifact assemblages regardless of kind. Our analysis further demonstrates that CV is an excellent measure of standardization and provides a robust statistical technique for comparing standardization in samples of artifacts.},

The discipline has well established and tested methods to track change through time and to evaluate the function of artifacts that depend upon measures of variation in the archaeological record.

This paper explores one source of variation, copying errors, and systematically examines how cultural transmission processes act to amplify, reduce, or maintain such variation. Using simple models, we generate expected distributions for the amount of variation that occurs through time under varying circumstances. This variation is caused by small errors that are transmitted from one person to another in the propagation and replication of cultural traits. These baseline values provide useful null models for explaining variation in prehistoric assemblages of artifacts. We use measurements of projectile points from Owens Valley and Woodland ceramics from Illinois to demonstrate the value of this approach.},

Although increasing in popularity in recent years, CT has not seen extensive use in archaeological research, despite the quantitative rigor of many CT models and the ability to create testable hypotheses. Part of the reason for the slow adoption, we argue, has been the continuing focus on change in central tendency and mode in archaeology, instead of change in dispersion or variance. Yet archaeological research provides an excellent data source for exploring processes of CT. We review CT research in the anthropological sciences and outline the benefits and drawbacks of this theoretical framework for the study of material culture. We argue that CT can shed much light on our understandings of why material technology changes over time, including explanations of differential rates of change among different technologies. We further argue that transmission processes are greatly affected by the content, context, and mode of transmission and fundamentally structure variation in material culture. Including ideas from CT can provide greater context for explaining and understanding changes in the variation of artifacts over time. Finally, we outline what we feel should be the goals of CT research in archaeology in the coming years.},

	abstract = {A wide range of theories and methods inspired from evolutionary biology have recently been used to investigate temporal changes in the frequency of archaeological material. Here we follow this research agenda and present a novel approach based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which enables the evaluation of multiple competing evolutionary models formulated as computer simulations. This approach offers the opportunity to: 1) flexibly integrate archaeological biases derived from sampling and time averaging; 2) estimate model parameters in a probabilistic fashion, taking into account both prior knowledge and empirical data; and 3) shift from an hypothesis-testing to a model selection approach. We applied ABC to a chronologically fine-grained Western European Neolithic armature assemblage, comparing three possible candidate models of evolutionary change: 1) unbiased transmission; 2) conformist bias; and 3) anti-conformist bias. Results showed that unbiased and anti-conformist transmission models provide equally good explanatory models for the observed data, suggesting high levels of equifinality. We also examined whether the appearance of the Bell Beaker culture was correlated with marked changes in the frequency of different armature types. Comparisons between the empirical data and expectations generated from the simulation model did not show any evidence in support of this hypothesis and instead indicated lower than expected dissimilarity between assemblages dated before and after the emergence of the Bell Beaker culture.},

We find that data from a recently excavated Late Coalition period village on the Pajarito Plateau of New Mexico, Burnt Mesa Pueblo, exhibits less diversity in ceramic style than would be expected, if ceramic styles were “neutral,” using as a baseline the ceramic diversity that typifies local hamlets of the Early Coalition period. The evidence suggests that the local transmission processes affecting ceramic design were biased towards conformity (i.e., exhibit frequency-dependent bias). We take conformity in ceramic design to be one symptom of a developing social system that places great value on within-group cooperation, helping alleviate cooperative dilemmas in these early aggregates.},

	abstract = {Detecting and diagnosing the causes of change through time in archaeological assemblages is a core enterprise of archaeology. Evolutionary approaches to this problem typically cast the causes of culture change as being either stochastic in origin, or arising from selection. Stochastic sources of change include random innovations, copying errors, drift and founder effects among dispersing groups. Selection is driven by differences in payoffs between cultural variants. Most efforts to identify these evolutionary forces in the archaeological record have relied on assessing how well the predictions from a neutral-stochastic model of cultural transmission fit a data set. Selection is inferred when the neutral-stochastic model fits poorly. A problem with this approach is that it does not test directly for the presence selection. Moreover, it does not account for the fact that both neutral-stochastic and selective forces can act at the same time on the same cultural variants. A different approach based on the Price Equation allows for the simultaneous measurement of selective and stochastic forces. This paper extends use of the Price Equation to the analysis of selective and stochastic forces operating on multiple artifact types within an assemblage. Ceramic data presented by Steele et al. (2010, Vol. 37(6): 1348–1358) from the Late Bronze Age Hittite site of Boğazköy-Hattusa, Turkey, provide an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of this model. The results suggest that selection is a dominant process driving the frequency evolution of different bowl rim types within the assemblage and that stochastic forces played little or no role. It is also clear, however, that we should be attentive to combinations of direct and indirect selective effects within assemblages consisting of multiple artifact types.},

The analysis shows three things: (1) that environmental learning alone never produces the 5-shaped adoption dynamics typically observed in the spread of novel practices, ideas, and technologies; (2) that biased cultural transmission always produces the S-shaped temporal dynamics; and (3) that a combination of environmental learning and biased cultural transmission can generate 5-dynamics but only when biased cultural transmission is the predominate force in the spread of new behaviors. These findings suggest that biased cultural transmission processes are much more important to understanding the diffusion of innovations and sociocultural evolution than is often assumed by most theorists.

To help characterize the type of transmission bias, we modify the neutral model to include a content-based bias and two context-based biases (conformity and anti-conformity).

Here, we use agent-based simulations to explore the effects of frequency-dependent copying (e.g., conformity and anti-conformity) on this power-law distribution. We find that when traits are actively selected on the basis of their frequency, then the power-law distribution is severely disrupted. Conformity generates a “winner-takes-all” distribution in which popular traits dominate, while anti-conformity generates a “humped” distribution in which traits of intermediate frequency are favoured. However, a more passive frequency-dependent “trimming”, in which traits are selectively ignored on the basis of their frequency, generates reasonable approximations to the power-law distribution. This frequency-dependent trimming may therefore be difficult to distinguish from genuine random copying using population-level data alone. Implications for the study of both human and nonhuman culture are discussed.},

This report applies a suite of previously published methods to assemblages formed under unbiased cultural transmission. The results show that, even under the controlled conditions afforded by computer simulation, all but one method (the variants frequency approach) fail to identify unbiased cultural transmission in samples collected from moderately to severely time-averaged assemblages. While it is encouraging that the method that is best at identifying unbiased cultural transmission in simulated time-averaged data also is relatively robust to relative sample size, additional work is needed to determine whether even the variants frequency approach is powerful enough to identify “weakly” biased forms of cultural transmission in real-world assemblages.},

Recent models of this process predict that large, well-connected populations will have more diverse and complex tool kits than small, isolated populations. While several examples of the loss of technology in small populations are consistent with this prediction, it found no support in two systematic quantitative tests. Both studies were based on data from continental populations in which contact rates were not available, and therefore these studies do not provide a test of the models. Here, we show that in Oceania, around the time of early European contact, islands with small populations had less complicated marine foraging technology. This finding suggests that explanations of existing cultural variation based on optimality models alone are incomplete because demography plays an important role in generating cumulative cultural adaptation. It also indicates that hominin populations with similar cognitive abilities may leave very different archaeological records, a conclusion that has important implications for our understanding of the origin of anatomically modern humans and their evolved psychology.},

The term “evolution” and its traditionally biological connotations, however, can provide a source of confusion, which might cause hindrance to those trying to understand the growing array of case studies that utilize these methods. Given this, a brief review of the current theoretical basis for cultural evolutionary approaches is given, which largely draws on social transmission theory. Thereafter, recent advances in the field are discussed, which have involved both methodological developments and a flourishing of empirical examples of application. Finally, future directions are considered, which, as in any developing field, will probably involve further development of both its theoretical and empirical basis, and the interaction of the two. As David Clarke identified almost half a century ago, the great strength of the archaeological record is its power to reveal meaningful patterns of artifactual variation over temporal and spatial scales, especially in statistical terms. Cultural evolutionary approaches offer a set of theoretical and methodological tools to approach, discover, and scientifically analyze this potential wealth of information about past societies. Future developments will necessarily follow, but the place of this related body of theory and techniques within archaeology is now firmly established.},

Here, we analyze a model in which the response is some form of punishment that is directed solely at noncooperators. We refer to such alternative forms of punishment as retribution. We show that cooperation enforced by retribution can lead to the evolution of cooperation in two qualitatively different ways. (1) If benefits of cooperation to an individual are greater than the costs to a single individual of coercing the other n − 1 individuals to cooperate, then strategies which cooperate and punish noncooperators, strategies which cooperate only if punished, and, sometimes, strategies which cooperate but do not punish will coexist in the long run. (2) If the costs of being punished are large enough, moralistic strategies which cooperate, punish noncooperators, and punish those who do not punish noncooperators can be evolutionarily stable. We also show, however, that moralistic strategies can cause any individually costly behavior to be evolutionarily stable, whether or not it creates a group benefit.},

All of the available evidence suggests that the societies of our Pliocene ancestors were like those of other social primates, and this means that human psychology has changed in ways that support larger, more cooperative societies that characterize modern humans. In this paper, we argue that cultural adaptation is a key factor in these changes. Over the last million years or so, people evolved the ability to learn from each other, creating the possibility of cumulative, cultural evolution. Rapid cultural adaptation also leads to persistent differences between local social groups, and then competition between groups leads to the spread of behaviours that enhance their competitive ability. Then, in such culturally evolved cooperative social environments, natural selection within groups favoured genes that gave rise to new, more pro-social motives. Moral systems enforced by systems of sanctions and rewards increased the reproductive success of individuals who functioned well in such environments, and this in turn led to the evolution of other regarding motives like empathy and social emotions like shame.},

	abstract = {Recent debates about memetics have revealed some widespread misunderstandings about Darwinian approaches to cultural evolution. Drawing from these debates, this paper disputes five common claims: (1) mental representations are rarely discrete, and therefore models that assume discrete, gene-like particles (i.e., replicators) are useless; (2) replicators are necessary for cumulative, adaptive evolution; (3) content-dependent psychological biases are the only important processes that affect the spread of cultural representations; (4) the “cultural fitness” of a mental representation can be inferred from its successful transmission; and (5) selective forces only matter if the sources of variation are random. We close by sketching the outlines of a unified evolutionary science of culture.},

	abstract = {Carbon isotope of total organic carbon (δ13Corg) and long-chain n-alkanes, which are terrestrial plant biomarkers, and their compound-specific carbon isotope ratios (δ13CALK) were investigated in the sediment of the Jeongok-ri Paleolithic Site in central Korea to interpret changes in paleovegetation and paleoclimate. The δ13Corg ranged between approximately −24‰ and −27‰, suggesting different organic matter sources. Relatively lighter δ13Corg occurred in lower part and the occurrence of heavier δ13Corg in upper part may indicate terrestrial C3 plant dominance and/or a mixture of C3 and C4 plants, respectively. The patterns of n-alkane distribution were characterized by a continuous predominance of odd-numbered n-alkanes, particularly nC29 and nC31, and by variation in the distribution of even-numbered n-alkanes. Total concentration of n-alkanes and distributions of each number of n-alkanes are quite different over time, suggesting paleovegetation changes. The average chain length (ACL) and carbon preferences index (CPI) showed gradual variations with distinctive switching points at about 160 ka. This variation reflecting changes in paleovegetation type, is coincident with those of the δ13Corg. Individual n-alkane isotopes, δ13CALK, ranged between −18.64‰ and −38.09‰, suggesting different sources of n-alkanes. Although some petrogenic sources of n-alkanes were possible, the distribution of n-alkanes and their δ13CALK support paleovegetation and paleoclimatic variations in Jeongok-ri Paleolithic site, Korea for the last 300 ka.},

	abstract = {An interhemispheric hydrologic seesaw—in which latitudinal migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) produce simultaneous wetting (increased precipitation) in one hemisphere and drying in the other—has been discovered in some tropical and subtropical regions. For instance, Chinese and Brazilian subtropical speleothem (cave formations such as stalactites and stalagmites) records show opposite trends in time series of oxygen isotopes (a proxy for precipitation variability) at millennial to orbital timescales, suggesting that hydrologic cycles were antiphased in the northerly versus southerly subtropics. This tropical to subtropical hydrologic phenomenon is likely to be an initial and important climatic response to orbital forcing. The impacts of such an interhemispheric hydrologic seesaw on higher-latitude regions and the global climate system, however, are unknown. Here we show that the antiphasing seen in the tropical records is also present in both hemispheres of the mid-latitude western Pacific Ocean. Our results are based on a new 550,000-year record of the growth frequency of speleothems from the Korean peninsula, which we compare to Southern Hemisphere equivalents. The Korean data are discontinuous and derived from 24 separate speleothems, but still allow the identification of periods of peak speleothem growth and, thus, precipitation. The clear hemispheric antiphasing indicates that the sphere of influence of the interhemispheric hydrologic seesaw over the past 550,000 years extended at least to the mid-latitudes, such as northeast Asia, and that orbital-timescale ITCZ shifts can have serious effects on temperate climate systems. Furthermore, our result implies that insolation-driven ITCZ dynamics may provoke water vapour and vegetation feedbacks in northern mid-latitude regions and could have regulated global climate conditions throughout the late Quaternary ice age cycles.},

	abstract = {The Korean Peninsula is located in the intraplate regime of the Eurasian plate, and numerous historical and instrumental earthquakes have been recorded. Among these, the largest earthquakes were recorded in and around the Gyeongju and Ulsan areas in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula. We recently reexamined faults in Jinhyun and Jintee, part of the Ulsan fault swarm, to clarify the average slip rate and the maximum potential magnitude of future earthquakes. The Jinhyun fault extends to the Tabgol fault (J-T fault), and the Jintee fault extends to the Singye (S-J fault). The faults cut through alluvial fans and are covered by unconsolidated granite washes on Tertiary granite. All of these faults show reverse sense of motion such that the Tertiary granite has been moved upward with a high angle relative to the Quaternary sediments. Most sediment samples from the Jinhyun and Jintee faults showed quartz OSL ages of ca. 40–60 ka. The calculated vertical slip rate for the Jinhyun and Jintee faults is in the range of 0.18–0.28 mm/y. Based on maximum earthquake magnitudes calculated from geological survey results as well as historical and instrumental earthquake information, the maximum potential magnitudes of future earthquakes in the Gyeongju area are estimated to range from 4.6 to 5.6. This suggests that the potential maximum magnitude in the southern Korean Peninsula is presumably not more than 6.},

	abstract = {Large direct human impacts on the Yeongsan River resulting from the construction of two large weirs on the main stream, and dredging of almost all sections of the main river has occurred in the past 5 years. Subsequent to these human impacts, some problems related to the sediment budget, such as channel changes, have occurred. To evaluate the dominant source of suspended sediment in the Yeongsan River, three time-integrated suspended-sediment samplers were installed in the upper and middle Yeongsan River (YS-S1, -S2, and -S3), and we obtained suspended-sediment samples every month. Potential sources of the suspended sediment were sampled using a soil scraper on the forest floor and channel bank. Source fingerprinting was conducted using 137Cs, which exhibits distinguishable characteristics of surface and subsurface (bank) materials. Probability distribution functions fit to the detected values of 137Cs at the forest floor and channel bank were derived. The relative contributions of forest floor and bank materials to suspended sediment in the Yeongsan River were calculated using Monte Carlo simulation and a simple mixing model, and the results indicated that the dominant source of suspended sediment was bank materials. Dredging a riverbed and constructing river-crossing facilities can affect the channel in many ways, but it remains unclear from this study how much the human impacts influenced channel erosion due to the absence of pre-interference data. However, this study may contribute to planning prevention measures for sediment problems induced by human impacts in the Yeongsan River catchment. Additionally, to reduce the uncertainty and limitations of the 137Cs methodology, a multi-fingerprinting approach using geochemical analysis, various radionuclides, and so forth is needed for better spatial and temporal evaluation of the sediment sources.},

	abstract = {A 5.88-m-long core taken from Lake Ulaan was studied for high-resolution paleoclimatic changes during the last 17 000 years. The core sediments are divided into three units based on grain-size distribution: unit 1 (top to 392 cm depth, covering the last 11 200 years), unit 2 (392–530 cm, 11.2–15 ka) and unit 3 (530–588 cm, 15.0–16.7 ka). These sediments were transported by local westerly winds (units 1 and 3) and fluvial processes (unit 2). Based on major element compositions and geological setting of adjacent areas, provenance of unit 1 sediments was interpreted to be the Lake terrane, and that of unit 2 to be the Idermeg terrane. Unit 3 sediments were derived from the Gobi Altai terrane. The records of total organic carbon, C/N ratio and weathering intensity suggest that paleoclimate in the source area of Lake Ulaan sediment was most humid during the Early Holocene, humid during the mid-Holocene and dry in the Late Holocene. The decrease of humidity through the Holocene is a typical characteristic of the East Asian monsoon region. Comparison with lacustrine records of other Mongolia regions suggests that the northern boundary of East Asian summer-monsoon influence could have been located further north than previously assumed.

Crossing vegetated pluvial corridors from northeastern Africa into the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant and expanding further into Eurasia, Australia and the Americas, early H. sapiens experienced massive time-varying climate and sea level conditions on a variety of timescales. Hitherto it has remained difficult to quantify the effect of glacial- and millennial-scale climate variability on early human dispersal and evolution. Here we present results from a numerical human dispersal model, which is forced by spatiotemporal estimates of climate and sea level changes over the past 125 thousand years. The model simulates the overall dispersal of H. sapiens in close agreement with archaeological and fossil data and features prominent glacial migration waves across the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant region around 106–94, 89–73, 59–47 and 45–29 thousand years ago. The findings document that orbital-scale global climate swings played a key role in shaping Late Pleistocene global population distributions, whereas millennial-scale abrupt climate changes, associated with Dansgaard–Oeschger events, had a more limited regional effect.},

	abstract = {At nowadays, the severe greenhouse effect causes rapid sea level rise 
around the Korea Peninsula. Paleo-climate researches have been
concentrating on hydrological activities during the mid-Holocene optimum
and the last interglacial period to use the paleo-analogues data in
predicting the future hydrological environments. The previous studies on
the late Pleistocene interstadial coastal sediments have primarily been
biased towards the terraces of the east coast in the Korean Peninsula.
According to the results, the last interglacial marine terraces of the
east coast were existed at 18 m in elevation. Uplift rate of them was
presumed to be 0.1mm/year (Choi, 2006). Also, the stratigraphy of the
Quaternary coastal deposits of the Yellow Sea has been suggested by Park
et al. (1998) and Lim et al. (2003). In recent, Jang et al. (2014)
reported the OSL dated Eemian marine deposit along the southwest coast
of Korea. However, the age-equivalent outcrops of the south coast are
not discovered yet. The first outcrops of the late Pleistocene
interstadial coastal sediment above the present sea level were
discovered at IJin-ri site of Haenam, south coast of Korea. It would be
very useful for calculating the rates of Eemian sea level rise and
uplift of south coast of Korea. 62 cubic samples were collected at 6 cm
intervals from the section (4.8-8.83m in elevation). Four sedimentary
units, from Unit 1 to 4 in ascending order, are distinguished based on
sedimentary textures and grain size distribution as follows: Unit 1
(sand, 4.8 m-5.32 m in elevation), Unit 2 (silty clay, 5.32 m-6.8 m in
elevation), Unit 3 (gravelly sand, 6.8m-7.8m in elevation) and, Unit
4(sandy gravel, 7.8m-8.83m in elevation). The sediments which included
rounded or semi-rounded gravels are thought to be transported from
marine. Also, the assemblages of clay minerals from the sections are
similar to those of Yellow Sea. It shows the possibility that the
sediments originated from marine during high sea level stage of Eemian
and/or storm surge.},

They are paralic and marine, separated by a ravinement surface. The lower paralic component below the ravinement surface consists of two sedimentary units (P1 and P2) preserved from shoreface erosion. The top surface of the paralic unit is truncated by a sharp erosional surface. This surface is overlain by three sedimentary units (M1, M2, and M3), which were produced by shoreface erosion that shifted landward during transgression.
The transgressive deposits in this area, considering geometries and distribution patterns, can be divided into three types (I, II, and III). Type I overlying the lowstand systems tract is confined to the shelf margin, and consists of a thick paralic unit P1 and a relatively thin marine unit M1. Type II on the mid shelf has no paralic component and the marine units M1 or M2 directly overly the sequence boundary.

Several modeling studies support the idea that population size can affect cultural evolution, but the results of empirical studies are ambiguous. Here we report a study that used tool kit data from recent hunter-gatherers, in conjunction with correlation analysis and a global sample, a continental sample, and a regional sample. The results of the analyses do not support the hypothesis. Population size was correlated with some tool kit variables in the global sample, but these relationships disappeared when two factors that have previously been found to affect hunter-gatherer tool kits—risk of resource failure and mobility—were controlled for. Population size was not correlated with the tool kit variables in the other samples. The regression analyses also did not support the population size hypothesis. Together, these results challenge the use of population size to explain patterns in the Paleolithic archaeological record. Population size may explain some of the patterns in question, but this needs to be demonstrated through tests in which the population size hypothesis is explicitly pitted against competing hypotheses, such as adaptation to shifting ecological conditions.},

Chronological and geographical variation has been described in terms of typological differences, but there are few anthropological explanations of lithic diversity and change. An analysis of an experimentally produced Hoabinhian assemblage is undertaken here to show which flake variables are significant indicators of assemblage reduction intensity. The results show that recording the presence of overhang removal, interior platform angle, and percentage of dorsal cortex will provide robust data on the extent of assemblage reduction. A new method for detecting assemblage variation based on the location of dorsal cortex on flakes is also presented and experimentally verified. These methods are designed to take advantage of the typical geometry and reduction patterns of Hoabinhian assemblages. These findings provide another tool to build anthropological explanations of Hoabinhian archaeology.},

To do this, archaeologists have focused primarily on variations in lithic morphology. Although the forms of stone artifacts are determined by a combination their utilitarian function, 'style', and the physical constraints of knapping different cryptocrystalline rocks, there is widespread belief that style provides the best information about social group membership. Style, however, is not a unified concept, including both passive variability resulting from stochastic processes and actively encoded social information, constrained by selection and manipulated by the makers and users of artifacts. A neo-Darwinian framework is used to evaluate differing concepts of style and their applicability to the lithic archaeological record. Identifying prehistoric social entities and tracing cultural relationships is loosely analogous, methodologically and theoretically, to identifying taxa and tracing ancestor/descendant relationships in biology. Lithic technology is also examined from the point of view of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory to identity sources of morphological variability most likely to mark group social identity, and suggest methodologies best able to identify and differentiate prehistoric social groups.},

In lithic artifacts, use-life can be expressed as the extraction of utility, or work potential, from existing stone volume. Using experimental data and generalized linear modeling, this study develops models of artifact use-life on cores in the form of reduction intensity. We then apply these models to two archaeological case studies to (a) reconstruct the reduction intensities of archaeological cores and (b) investigate the survivorship curves of these archaeological cores across the reduction continuum using the Weibull function. Results indicate variation in core reduction and maintenance with respect to raw material properties and place use history and implicate evolutionary differences between Early Stone Age hominins and Holocene modern humans.},

	abstract = {Research into the processes that form the archaeological record is an important component of archaeological practice because formation processes are a key link between the materials that archaeologists study and prehistoric societies that they seek to understand. Computational modeling is a comparatively new technology with potential to provide new insights into the dynamics of human societies, but which has been minimally applied so far in the study of archaeological formation processes. We use computational modeling as an experimental environment to examine processes that form the archaeological record of lithic assemblages. This is especially important for lithics because it is a largely extinct technology and we cannot directly observe the accumulation of lithic assemblages over time frames comparable to those represented in the archaeological record. We systematically evaluate the individual and combined effects of the length of stay at sites, raw material distribution, differences in activities performed with lithics, and movement patterns on lithic assemblages that accumulate over different time intervals. Not surprisingly, increased access to raw material decreases the frequency of retouched artifacts in assemblages, while tasks that require more lithic use produce assemblages with higher retouch frequencies. While length of stay affects the density of lithic accumulations at sites, it has little effect on assemblages composition. Mobility patterns alone have limited impact on assemblage composition. However, mobility coupled with place provisioning or individual provisioning, associated with logistical and residential mobility strategies respectively, have significant impacts on assemblage composition consistent with prior empirical studies. Counterintuitively, the artifact palimpsests of multiple occupations that characterize most archaeological deposits may provide better information about human ecology and changing adaptations than assemblages that represent snapshots of a single or a few occupations. This work provides valuable new, quantitative insights into the information about past human social, ecological, and technological practices embedded in lithic assemblages.},

	abstract = {Lithic artifacts are increasingly being used to address questions in evolutionary, i.e., historical, terms. The explicit assumption in such analyses is that lithic attributes reflect patterns of inheritance via social learning. However, both raw material and reduction factors are known to be potential sources of lithic variation. The cultural–evolutionary analysis of lithic variability must, therefore, reconcile heritable and nonheritable sources of variation under a single coherent framework. Moreover, there is a frequent assumption that conveniently measureable features, such as the relative shape of a biface at a specific point of its length, can be used as indicators of heritable variation. The use of such traits, however, is potentially questionable, especially in the light of controlled experiments that indicate that traits such as platform depths and angles influence the form of individual flakes. As such, it may be reasonable to consider whether such features represent more appropriate analytical units. Here, we contend that the solution to these problems lies in application of a “quantitative genetics” approach, which was designed to solve directly analogous problems in biology. This approach explicitly models multiple sources of variation simultaneously. Moreover, it provides a logical rationale for how evolutionary forces (e.g., drift and selection) can operate when only part of this variation is potentially heritable. We outline specifically how quantitative genetic theory can be rewritten for use with lithic artifacts. Thereafter, we provide example analyses of data, which support our case. We conclude by summarizing the merits of this framework and outline future extensions.},

Despite the presence of more than two dozen adze quarries in Hawai'i, and previous attempts at replicating adze preforms and positing reduction sequences in Polynesia, there is no detailed study that clearly defines the steps and stages of quadrangular adze preform manufacture (the most common form in Hawai'i), and the resulting characteristic debitage. In this paper we examine the sequence of adze production for a population of 109 adzes from Moloka'i, documenting the transition from blanks to preforms to the finished objects that were transported away from quarries. Reduction intensity is measured using the Scar Density Index (Clarkson, 2013) calculated from 3D scans. We document the sequence of cumulative additions of characteristic features to adzes (e.g. bidirectional edges, bevel, poll and tang) as reduction intensity increases. We also note the reasons for adze rejection at each stage of reduction. Our study provides the first detailed analysis of adze reduction in Polynesia facilitated and standardised by 3D scanning technology. Hopefully, it will serve as a useful benchmark for objectively and systematically comparing adze technology in other parts of Hawai'i and across Polynesia, leading to a better understanding of regional and temporal variation in adze technology.},

	abstract = {Blank size and form represent one of the main sources of variation in lithic assemblages. They reflect economic properties of blanks and factors such as efficiency and use life. These properties require reliable measures of size, namely edge length and surface area. These measures, however, are not easily captured with calipers. Most attempts to quantify these features employ estimates; however, the efficacy of these estimations for measuring critical features such as blank surface area and edge length has never been properly evaluated. In addition, these parameters are even more difficult to acquire for retouched implements as their original size and hence indication of their previous utility have been lost. It has been suggested, in controlled experimental conditions, that two platform variables, platform thickness and exterior platform angle, are crucial in determining blank size and shape meaning that knappers can control the interaction between size and efficiency by selecting specific core angles and controlling where fracture is initiated. The robustness of these models has rarely been tested and confirmed in context other than controlled experiments. In this paper, we evaluate which currently employed caliper measurement methods result in the highest accuracy of size estimations of blanks, and we evaluate how platform variables can be used to indirectly infer aspects of size on retouched artifacts. Furthermore, we investigate measures of different platform management strategies that control the shape and size of artifacts. To investigate these questions, we created an experimental lithic assemblage, we digitized images to calculate 2D surface area and edge length, which are used as a point of comparison for the caliper measurements and additional analyses. The analysis of aspects of size determinations and the utility of blanks contributes to our understanding of the technological strategies of prehistoric knappers and what economic decisions they made during process of blank production.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that Levallois-style core reduction offered potential practical benefits to hominin populations. However, none of these studies have yet considered one of the most important functional attributes of flake tools, which is edge angle. To address this shortcoming, we statistically examined flakes produced experimentally during “classic” or “lineal” Levallois core production and reduction. The primary aim of our analyses was to statistically test the null hypothesis of “no difference” between the edge angles of “Levallois” products and the flakes involved in their production. We employ existing edge angle analytical techniques and develop new comparative methodologies to assess flake blank standardization through the case of Levallois core reduction. Having determined the statistical properties of our experimental Levallois reductions, we thereafter evaluated to what extent edge angles produced may, or may not, have been useful to prehistoric hominins. Our analyses demonstrated that the experimentally produced Levallois edge angles were indeed statistically different from the flakes involved in their production. These differences were evident both in terms of relatively higher (i.e., more obtuse) edge angles than debitage flakes and in being significantly less variable around their higher mean edge angles compared to debitage flakes. However, based on current knowledge of how flake edge angle properties relate to issues of functionality, such differences would not have been detrimental to their functionality. Indeed, the edge angle properties they possess would have provided distinct benefits to hominins engaged in their manufacture. Most notably, Levallois-style core organization and reduction would have provided hominins with a reliable means of consistently producing flakes (i.e., “Levallois flakes”) possessing average flake angles that are beneficial in terms of providing a viable cutting edge yet not being so acute as to be friable upon application. Hence, edge angle properties join an array of other features that provide logical motive for why hominins may have organized core production and reduction around Levallois-style patterns at various times and places during the Mid-Late Pleistocene.},

The “reduction sequence” is a specific stage of the chaîne opératoire that many archaeologists have attempted to measure. Many of these attempts fail to recognize that “reduction” is a three-dimensional process, and thus should be measured with an appropriate three-dimensional unit: volume.

Our own tests, using different experimental procedures, reached much less optimistic conclusions. Here, we apply their own measurement procedures, and successfully duplicate their results. It does not follow, however, that our now-consistently high correlations have a causal connection. As GIUR values increase, they are less able to estimate the actual loss of flake mass. It appears, therefore, that incremental loss of flake mass need not be the sole driver of the GIUR value. If the correlation is an inevitable byproduct of the experiment's design, as it now appears, then analyses based on this high correlation will be misleading. The GIUR remains, however, and excellent gauge of flake edge exhaustion.},

In the arid interior of Australia, the archaeological record of human occupation is known only from relatively few locations, and palaeoenvironmental records with resolution on timescales akin to human lifetimes are rare. Even where detailed archaeological and palaeoenvironmental studies have been undertaken concurrently, it has proven difficult to match the temporal resolution of both the archaeological and sedimentary records. One approach is to make use of the extensive surface archaeological record and match it to high-resolution palaeoenvironmental records from elsewhere. Here, we utilise radiocarbon age determinations on charcoal from the deflated remains of heat retainer hearths from surface archaeological contexts in western NSW. Correlations with two different but related sets of environmental proxy data (sea surface temperature fluctuations from the western Pacific/South China Sea and Australian dust deposition records from southern New Zealand) allow investigation of human responses to global environmental changes at a common temporal scale. The correlations suggest a relationship between rapid climatic changes occurring over the last 3000years and occupation by Aboriginal people in the arid region of western New South Wales. Aboriginal people abandoned large regions during times of lower rainfall and increased dust transport, with some but not all regions reoccupied during periods of increased summer rainfall. Environmental fluctuations during the late Holocene are likely to have posed marked challenges for Aboriginal populations who occupied the region. The patterns of radiocarbon assays from hearths provide a window into the nature of their response.},

Decision making in replicative knapping is here used to explore the degree of behavioural and cognitive complexity involved in five different types of stone tool manufacture (bipolar, discoidal, biface, Levallois and prismatic blade) that represent the evolution of core reduction strategies from the Oldowan through to the Upper Palaeolithic. While some hypothesise that each key transition was marked by an increase in cognitive complexity, such hypotheses remain untested assumptions. Determining the level of behavioural complexity involved in each of these core reduction strategies using problem-solution distance modelling offers a means of detecting significant increases in the level of human cognitive complexity displayed over time. To directly test for differences in complexity among knapping schema, replication experiments were conducted by two highly skilled knappers. Experiments were filmed and the duration of different stages in the sequence was annotated. Hierarchical diagrams were produced showing the organisation of the different actions involved in stone tool knapping. The results show a pattern of increasingly complex behaviour through the sequence of bipolar, discoidal, prismatic blade, biface, and Levallois knapping. Neanderthals and their contemporaries, Homo sapiens, employed knapping technologies exhibiting comparably high levels of complexity.},

Copying errors that occur during the manufacture of artifactual traditions are potentially a major source of variation. It has been proposed that material items produced via “additive” processes (e.g., pottery) will possess less variation than traditions produced via “reductive” processes (e.g., stone knapping). The logic of this premise is that “additive” production methods more readily allow for the reversal of copying errors compared to strictly “reductive-only” processes. Here, we tested this hypothesis in shape data using an experimental framework in which we generated and statistically analyzed morphometry (size-adjusted) shape data under controlled and replicable conditions. Participants engaged in one of two alternative conditions: an irreversible (“reductive-only”) manufacturing process or a reversible (“additive-reductive”) process. With a number of factors held constant, participants were required to copy the shape of a “target form” as accurately as possible using a standardized block of plasticine and a steel table knife. Results demonstrated statistically greater levels of shape-copying errors in the replicas produced in the reductive-only condition. This indicates that “mutation rates” in the shape attributes of artifactual traditions produced via reductive processes are inherently greater than those produced via alternative means. Several implications for the study of variation in artifactual traditions are discussed.

Resumen
Los errores de copiado que ocurren durante tradiciones de la manufactura de artefactos constituyen potencialmente una fuente importante de variación. Se ha sugerido que los objetos producidos mediante procesos “aditivos” (p.ej. cerámica) variarían menos que aquéllos producidos mediante procesos “reductivos” (p.ej. tallado depiedra) debido a que, a diferencia de los procesos estrictamente reductivos, los métodos aditivos de producción facilitarían la correción de errores de copiado. Aquí pusi-mos a prueba esta hipótesis en un marco experimental en el que generamos y analizamos estadisticamente datos morfométricos (ajustados al tamaño) en condiciones controladas y reproducibles. Los participantes tomaron parte en una de dos situaciones: en un proceso de manufactura irreversible (“sólo reductivo”) o en unproceso reversible (“aditivo-reductivo”). Se pidíó a los participantes copiar la forma de un “objeto modelo“ con la mayor precisión posible utilizando un bloque estandarizado de plastilina y un cuchillo metálico. Los resultados demostraron estadísticamente un mayor número de errores de copiado en las réplicas producidas en la situación “sólo reductiva”. Esto indica que la “tasa de mutacion” en artefactos producidos mediante procesos reductivos es inherentemente mayor que en aquéllos producidos mediante otros procesos. Se discuten algunas implicaciones para el estudio de variaciones en artefactos tradiciones.},

Cognitively based explanations, which presume either lack of ability to innovate or extreme conformism, do not account for the totality of the empirical patterns. Following recent research, this study explores the effects of demographic factors on rates of culture change and diversification. We investigate whether the appearance of stability in early Paleolithic technologies could result from frequent extinctions of local subpopulations within a persistent metapopulation. A spatially explicit agent-based model was constructed to test the influence of local extinction rate on three general cultural patterns that archaeologists might observe in the material record: total diversity, differentiation among spatially defined groups, and the rate of cumulative change. The model shows that diversity, differentiation, and the rate of cumulative cultural change would be strongly affected by local extinction rates, in some cases mimicking the results of conformist cultural transmission. The results have implications for understanding spatial and temporal patterning in ancient material culture.},

	abstract = {Quantitative, attribute-based analyses of stone tools (lithics) have been frequently used to facilitate large-scale comparative studies, attempt to mitigate problems of assemblage completeness and address interpretations of the co-occurrence of unrelated technological processes. However, a major barrier to the widespread acceptance of such methods has been the lack of quantified experiments that can be externally validated by theoretically distinct approaches in order to guide analysis and confidence in results. Given that quantitative, attribute-based studies now underpin several major interpretations of the archaeological record, the requirement to test the accuracy of such methods has become critical. In this paper, we test the utility of 31 commonly used flake attribute measurements for identifying discrete reduction trajectories through three refitted lithic sets from the Middle Palaeolithic open-air site of Le Pucheuil, in northern France. The experiment had three aims: (1) to determine which, if any, attribute measurements could be used to separate individual refitted sets, (2) to determine whether variability inherent in the assemblage was primarily driven by different reduction trajectories, as represented by the refitted sets, or other factors, and (3) to determine which multivariate tests were most suitable for these analyses. In order to test the sensitivity of the sample, we ran all analyses twice, the first time with all the available lithics pertaining to each refitted set and the second time with randomly generated 75 \% subsamples of each set. All results revealed the consistent accuracy of 16 attribute measurements in quadratic and linear discriminant analyses, principal component analyses and dissimilarity matrices. These results therefore provide the first quantified attribute formula for comparative analyses of Levallois reduction methods and a basis from which further experiments testing core and retouch attributes may be conducted.},

Yet a number of studies comparing two different knapping technologies have found no significant differences in edge production. Using digital analysis methods we present an investigation of raw material efficiency in eight core technologies broadly representative of the long-term evolution of lithic technology. These are bipolar, multiplatform, discoidal, biface, Levallois, prismatic blade, punch blade and pressure blade production. Raw material efficiency is assessed by the ratio of cutting edge length to original core mass. We also examine which flake attributes contribute to maximising raw material efficiency, as well as compare the difference between expert and intermediate knappers in terms of cutting edge produced per gram of core. We identify a gradual increase in raw material efficiency over the broad sweep of lithic technological evolution. The results indicate that the most significant transition in efficiency likely took place with the introduction of small foliate biface, Levallois and prismatic blade knapping, all introduced in the Middle Stone Age / Middle Palaeolithic among early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. This suggests that no difference in raw material efficiency existed between these species. With prismatic blade technology securely dated to the Middle Palaeolithic, by including the more recent punch and pressure blade technology our results dispel the notion that the transition to the Upper Palaeolithic was accompanied by an increase in efficiency. However, further increases in cutting edge efficiency are evident, with pressure blades possessing the highest efficiency in this study, indicating that late/epi-Palaeolithic and Neolithic blade technologies further increased efficiency.},

Cognitively based explanations, which presume either lack of ability to innovate or extreme conformism, do not account for the totality of the empirical patterns. Following recent research, this study explores the effects of demographic factors on rates of culture change and diversification. We investigate whether the appearance of stability in early Paleolithic technologies could result from frequent extinctions of local subpopulations within a persistent metapopulation. A spatially explicit agent-based model was constructed to test the influence of local extinction rate on three general cultural patterns that archaeologists might observe in the material record: total diversity, differentiation among spatially defined groups, and the rate of cumulative change. The model shows that diversity, differentiation, and the rate of cumulative cultural change would be strongly affected by local extinction rates, in some cases mimicking the results of conformist cultural transmission. The results have implications for understanding spatial and temporal patterning in ancient material culture.},

	abstract = {A long-standing debate in Pleistocene archaeology concerns the sources of variation in the technology of colonizing hunter-gatherers. One prominent example of this debate is Clovis technology (13,350–12,500 calendar years before present), which represents the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America. Clovis projectile points appear to have been made the same way regardless of region, but several studies have documented differences in shape that appear to be regional. Two processes have been proposed for shape variation: (1) stochastic mechanisms such as copy error (drift) and (2) Clovis groups adapting their hunting equipment to the characteristics of prey and local habitat. We used statistical analysis of Clovis-point flake-scar pattern and geometric morphometrics to examine whether drift alone could cause significant differences in the technology of Stone Age colonizing hunter-gatherers. Importantly, our analysis was intraregional to rule out a priori environmental adaptation. Our analysis confirmed that the production technique was the same across the sample, but we found significant shape differences in Clovis point populations made from distinct stone outcrops. Given that current archaeological evidence suggests stone outcrops were “hubs” of regional Clovis activity, our dichotomous, intraregional results quantitatively confirm that Clovis foragers engaged in two tiers of social learning. The lower, ancestral tier relates to point production and can be tied to conformist transmission of tool-making processes across the Clovis population. The upper, derived tier relates to point shape, which can be tied to drift that resulted from increased forager interaction at different stone-outcrop hubs and decreased forager interaction among groups using different outcrops. Given that Clovis artifacts represent the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America, our results suggest that we need to alter our theoretical understanding of how quickly drift can occur within a colonizing population and create differences among socially learned technological characters.},

Our study was conducted using materials from two culturally different sites, one dating to the Late Upper Paleolithic and the other to the Early Neolithic and our focus was on a single common tool class, endscrapers. Both sites are located in the same region, meaning that the hominins that inhabited them had the same opportunities for procuring locally abundant lithic raw materials. Geometric morphometrics and 3D-based reduction analyses were performed on the tools, and shape and reduction variables were cross-referenced in the search for any existing correlation between the two. Nomadic Late Upper Paleolithic groups exhibit a highly expedient tool management strategy, without shape maintenance, and considerable correlation was found between tool shape and reduction stage. Meanwhile, Early Neolithic groups left behind a curated assemblage, exhibiting shape maintenance and great reduction intensity. In this case, shape was found to be independent of reduction. Finally, we link these behaviors to different mobility strategies and raw-material transport costs, and consider the validity of exclusively typological approaches.},

The establishment of experimentally tested indexes providing strong correlations between estimated and real reduction are needed. In our work, we propose a new procedure for estimate reduction percentage. In this proposal, data are obtained from high resolution three-dimensional (3D) scans and manual measurements are avoided. The experimental test has been realized using distally retouched tools, the less suitable tools for reduction studies. The correlation levels obtained between the measured data and the estimated data increase substantially the original published from manual measurement, reaching a r2 value of 0.81 and a correlation of 0.9. The main contribution of the proposed method is the very high correlation obtained in the volume estimation (r2 = 0.89 and r = 0.94) using the 3D-based measurements.

Here we propose, in the spirit of Oswalt’s techno-units, that the complexity of lithic technology can be quantified by counting the procedural units involved in tool manufacture. We define procedural units as mutually exclusive manufacturing steps that make a distinct contribution to the finished form of a technology. As a proof of concept, we use the procedural-unit approach to measure the complexity of 13 Paleolithic assemblages. While preliminary, these results provide a quantitative benchmark confirming that lithic technological complexity increased throughout the Paleolithic period. The method to measure lithic complexity outlined here will allow us to revisit several claims made about change in technological complexity during human evolution.},

Garivaldino presents a range of dates from 11,660 to 7540 cal BP. Multivariate statistics applied to both traditional and geometric morphometric analyses failed to reveal any important changes in shape through time. However, the coefficients of variation presented a significant increase through time in three measurements related to projectile point neck and stem. The absence of change in shape might be related to small group size and low level of cultural innovation. Such cultural stability might be related to novelty-avoiding mechanisms or the operation of a meta-tradition that would be selected in very stable environments.

	abstract = {Lithic artifacts are increasingly being used to address questions in evolutionary, i.e., historical, terms. The explicit assumption in such analyses is that lithic attributes reflect patterns of inheritance via social learning. However, both raw material and reduction factors are known to be potential sources of lithic variation. The cultural–evolutionary analysis of lithic variability must, therefore, reconcile heritable and nonheritable sources of variation under a single coherent framework. Moreover, there is a frequent assumption that conveniently measureable features, such as the relative shape of a biface at a specific point of its length, can be used as indicators of heritable variation. The use of such traits, however, is potentially questionable, especially in the light of controlled experiments that indicate that traits such as platform depths and angles influence the form of individual flakes. As such, it may be reasonable to consider whether such features represent more appropriate analytical units. Here, we contend that the solution to these problems lies in application of a “quantitative genetics” approach, which was designed to solve directly analogous problems in biology. This approach explicitly models multiple sources of variation simultaneously. Moreover, it provides a logical rationale for how evolutionary forces (e.g., drift and selection) can operate when only part of this variation is potentially heritable. We outline specifically how quantitative genetic theory can be rewritten for use with lithic artifacts. Thereafter, we provide example analyses of data, which support our case. We conclude by summarizing the merits of this framework and outline future extensions.},

Decision making in replicative knapping is here used to explore the degree of behavioural and cognitive complexity involved in five different types of stone tool manufacture (bipolar, discoidal, biface, Levallois and prismatic blade) that represent the evolution of core reduction strategies from the Oldowan through to the Upper Palaeolithic. While some hypothesise that each key transition was marked by an increase in cognitive complexity, such hypotheses remain untested assumptions. Determining the level of behavioural complexity involved in each of these core reduction strategies using problem-solution distance modelling offers a means of detecting significant increases in the level of human cognitive complexity displayed over time. To directly test for differences in complexity among knapping schema, replication experiments were conducted by two highly skilled knappers. Experiments were filmed and the duration of different stages in the sequence was annotated. Hierarchical diagrams were produced showing the organisation of the different actions involved in stone tool knapping. The results show a pattern of increasingly complex behaviour through the sequence of bipolar, discoidal, prismatic blade, biface, and Levallois knapping. Neanderthals and their contemporaries, Homo sapiens, employed knapping technologies exhibiting comparably high levels of complexity.},

Copying errors that occur during the manufacture of artifactual traditions are potentially a major source of variation. It has been proposed that material items produced via “additive” processes (e.g., pottery) will possess less variation than traditions produced via “reductive” processes (e.g., stone knapping). The logic of this premise is that “additive” production methods more readily allow for the reversal of copying errors compared to strictly “reductive-only” processes. Here, we tested this hypothesis in shape data using an experimental framework in which we generated and statistically analyzed morphometry (size-adjusted) shape data under controlled and replicable conditions. Participants engaged in one of two alternative conditions: an irreversible (“reductive-only”) manufacturing process or a reversible (“additive-reductive”) process. With a number of factors held constant, participants were required to copy the shape of a “target form” as accurately as possible using a standardized block of plasticine and a steel table knife. Results demonstrated statistically greater levels of shape-copying errors in the replicas produced in the reductive-only condition. This indicates that “mutation rates” in the shape attributes of artifactual traditions produced via reductive processes are inherently greater than those produced via alternative means. Several implications for the study of variation in artifactual traditions are discussed.

Resumen
Los errores de copiado que ocurren durante tradiciones de la manufactura de artefactos constituyen potencialmente una fuente importante de variación. Se ha sugerido que los objetos producidos mediante procesos “aditivos” (p.ej. cerámica) variarían menos que aquéllos producidos mediante procesos “reductivos” (p.ej. tallado depiedra) debido a que, a diferencia de los procesos estrictamente reductivos, los métodos aditivos de producción facilitarían la correción de errores de copiado. Aquí pusi-mos a prueba esta hipótesis en un marco experimental en el que generamos y analizamos estadisticamente datos morfométricos (ajustados al tamaño) en condiciones controladas y reproducibles. Los participantes tomaron parte en una de dos situaciones: en un proceso de manufactura irreversible (“sólo reductivo”) o en unproceso reversible (“aditivo-reductivo”). Se pidíó a los participantes copiar la forma de un “objeto modelo“ con la mayor precisión posible utilizando un bloque estandarizado de plastilina y un cuchillo metálico. Los resultados demostraron estadísticamente un mayor número de errores de copiado en las réplicas producidas en la situación “sólo reductiva”. Esto indica que la “tasa de mutacion” en artefactos producidos mediante procesos reductivos es inherentemente mayor que en aquéllos producidos mediante otros procesos. Se discuten algunas implicaciones para el estudio de variaciones en artefactos tradiciones.},

	abstract = {Technological and morphological variability in lithic artifacts is commonly used to identify taxonomic entities in Paleolithic research contexts. Assemblages are mainly studied using either linear distance measurements or qualitative assessments of morphologies. Here, we present a method to quantify morphological variability in lithic artifacts using 3D models of stone artifacts. Our study on the sequence of the Upper Paleolithic layers V–I from the site Yabroud II in western Syria, demonstrates that utilizing 3D models provides a new insight into the variability of lithic technologies. We use quantitative data on convexities, twist and scar patterns on cores and blades, attributes previously not readily quantifiable, to trace technological change through the archaeological sequence. We are able to identify differences and translate these findings into a grouping of the layers. While layers VI–II are characterized by technological continuity and were grouped together, layers V and I can be separated from this group and represent technologically different groups chronologically before and after. Our results demonstrate the potential of 3D models for studying morphological variability in lithic assemblages.},

This technique has several unusual properties that complement existing methods of paleoclimate reconstruction. Most importantly, it is based on a homogeneous isotope exchange equilibrium and thus constrains temperature independent of the isotopic composition of waters from which carbonates grew. This method also appears to be generally insensitive to ‘vital effects’ that compromise many other paleothermometers based on the chemical properties of biominerals or organic matter, at least for those organisms that have been subjected to systematic study to-date (corals and foraminifera); however, discrepancies among some calibrations, particularly at low temperatures, may point toward the existence of vital effects in mollusks and other organisms. This review discusses the principles and calibrations of the technique, its uses in combination with conventional stable isotope measurements to constrain the δ18O of past waters, preservation of paleotemperatures in ancient materials, as well as current problems in our understanding of calibrations and interlaboratory data comparisons.},

In this paper, we present survey and excavation data from the Iroco region in the Central Altiplano of Bolivia to address questions related to the adaptive strategies engaged by Archaic Period highland foragers. Specifically, we focus on the nature of mobility, subsistence, and technological strategies, stemmed from principles in human behavioral ecology. Based on data from radiocarbon dates, lithic, and faunal analyses, we suggest that, similar to other mobile foraging societies in arid environments, highland foragers in Iroco engaged in seasonal residential mobility, consumed a broad range of faunal resources, and developed a curated technological toolkit within the context of ameliorated environmental conditions that prevailed during the early Holocene (11,500–8000 cal BP).},

	abstract = {Due to the presence of multiple partial modern human skeletons thought to have been interred along with a diversity of evidence of symbolic behavior, Zhoukoudian Upper Cave (ZKD UC; formally “Choukoutien”) from northern China has long been a critical site for understanding Late Quaternary human evolution and particularly the role eastern Asia played. Unfortunately, uncertainty regarding ZKD UC's chronology has long hindered determination of its importance in the debate over modern human origins. This situation has been particularly problematic because dates from the primary archaeological layers of ZKD UC have ranged from the Late Pleistocene to the Early Holocene (∼34–10 ka), with clearly different implications depending on which age is used. Here, we present a new set of accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating results from ZKD UC. Based on this new set of dates and further re-evaluations of the previous dating analyses, archaeological materials, published excavation reports and stratigraphy, we conclude that the ZKD UC archaeological layers minimally date to 35.1–33.5 ka. Given the similarities between the human fossils and archaeology between ZKD UC and western Eurasia, it is likely that the ZKD UC human foragers were part of dispersal events across northern Eurasia toward Siberia and eventually reaching into northern China.},

During the Middle Pleistocene a number of sites are found well away from major riverways suggesting an ability to transport potable water or perhaps an ability to be able to locate smaller bodies of fresh water. Given the paucity of evidence for storage containers until relatively recently in time, it is perhaps not that surprising that many of the Middle Pleistocene open-air sites are reportedly found in or near lacustrine environments. Hominins had a more restricted range due to climatic variation during the Early and early Middle Pleistocene, but were able to more successfully adapt to changing climes beginning during the late Middle Pleistocene. In part, this is due to a range of behavioral changes that hominins developed during the Pleistocene.},

Here, I review the current state of the Late Pleistocene behavioral record with a particular focus on the Korean and Japanese records. In addition to questioning the applicability of the three-stage (Lower/Middle/Upper) Paleolithic sequence in the region and advocating a two-stage model (Early/Late), I add a number of behaviors to the definition of the eastern Asian Late Paleolithic, traditionally defined based on the appearance of blade-tool technology. In particular, any definition of this cultural period for this region should include the appearance of tanged points, ground stone tools, trap-pit hunting, and importantly, watercraft. Tanged points and trap-pit hunting represent an expansion of the Late Paleolithic foragers’ diet breadth and an increased effectiveness in hunting large game. As well, ground stone tools, which included ground axes used for felling trees and woodwork, probably contributed to the building of sturdy watercraft necessary to make oceanic voyages. Finally, I briefly discuss the arguments for and against the pre-50,000 ka occupation of eastern Asia by modern Homo sapiens with a focus on four specific sites that are proposed to support the pre-50 ka model: Huanglong Cave, Fuyan Cave, Luna Cave (all in China), and Callao (Philippines).},

	abstract = {The semi-enclosed deep marginal East Sea is known by limited sill flow and low sea-surface salinity during the last glacial maximum (LGM) when sea level was about 130m lower than the present level. Although three straits (the Tsugaru, the Soya and the Tartar) with shallower than 130m sills were completely closed, the Korea Strait with a maximum sill depth of 140m seems to have persisted as a partial connection to the East Sea, allowing a sill flow. The volume transport at the Korea Strait during the LGM is estimated at approximately 0.3–1.1×1012m3/yr, by using bathymetry, seismic reflection profiles and current data. The low sea-surface salinity has been explained by the East China Sea Coast Water (ECSCW) and high precipitation. However, the existing geological observations indicate that precipitation was reduced in the glacial East Sea. The high-resolution numerical simulation results predict that evaporation (2.16mm/day) exceeded precipitation (1.43mm/day), further suggesting net evaporation (evaporation minus precipitation) rates (0.2×1012m3/yr) over the LGM East Sea. This signifies that the precipitation was not the factor lowering surface paleosalinity and that the paleo-Tsushima Water carried a huge amount of freshwater from the ECSCW than previously expected. The calculated surplus evaporation (0.2×1012m3/yr) and sill flow (0.3–1.1×1012m3/yr) are not identical, but they could be oceanographically considered as similar. The comparison between both values implies that most of the throughflow ultimately escaped the East Sea through the evaporation process during the LGM. The regional sea level in the almost isolated East Sea might be largely maintained by a rough balance between incoming throughflow and outgoing evaporation during the LGM. The geographic restriction due to lowered sea level and lower surface salinity by limited vertical mixing in the glacial East Sea are analogous to modern oceanographic features in the Black Sea.},

The exceptionally large number of tanged points suggests a specific site function at this location.

Here, we conduct a use-wear analysis of 95 tanged points from the Jingeuneul site. The use-wear analysis reveals that a considerable number of the tanged points show diagnostic impact fractures (DIFs). Because a large number of the tanged points appear to have been used as hunting weapons, a morphometric analysis is also undertaken to examine the potential projectile capability of the tanged points with DIFs. The large dimension of the DIFs and the complex fracture pattern of the tanged points, as well as the small morphometric values of the tip cross-sectional area, tip cross-sectional perimeter, and neck width of the tanged points, all suggest that the tanged points from the Jingeuneul site were mechanically propelled using a spear-thrower or a bow.},

Drawing on archaeology, anthropology, and ancient and modern history, the contributors range widely in time and space across hunting, farming and pastoralism, across ancient states, empires, and modern nation states. The aim, however, is a common one: to analyse in each case the structure of variability - particularly with regard to food supply - and review the range of responses offered by individual human communities. These responses commonly exploit various forms of mobility, economic diversification, storage, and exchange to deploy local or temporary abundance as a defence against shortage. Different levels of response are used at different levels of risk. Their success is fundamental to human survival and their adoption has important ramifications throughout cultural behaviour.},

	abstract = {Human ecodynamics (H.E.) refers to processes of stability, resilience, and change in socio-ecological relationships or systems. H.E. research involves interdisciplinary study of the human condition as it affects and is affected by the rest of the non-human world. In this paper, we review the intellectual history of the human ecodynamics concept over the past several decades, as it has emerged out of classical ecology, anthropology, behavioral ecology, resilience theory, historical ecology, and related fields, especially with respect to the study of long-term socioecological change. Those who study human ecodynamics reject the notion that humans should be considered external to the environments in which they live and have lived for millennia. Many are interested in the resilience and sustainability of past human-natural configurations, often striving to extract lessons from the past that can benefit society today. H.E. research, involving the study of paleoenvironments and archaeology, has taken shape around a series of methodological advances that facilitate the study of past chronology, paleoecology, paleodemography, mobility, trade, and social networks. It is only through integrated study of 'coupled human-natural systems'—'socio-ecosystems'—that we can hope to understand dynamic human-environmental interactions and begin to manage them for sustainable goals. Local and traditional or Indigenous knowledge provides another important influence to human ecodynamics research, and we explore how such knowledge can provide both expert witness into the operation of socioecological systems and insight into the human/cultural dimensions of those systems. Ultimately, we conclude that human ecodynamics is more encompassing than a number of related approaches and can provide a nexus for productive research. Through its interdisciplinary breadth, the framework unites scholarship that tends to be more isolated to address complex problems that are best tackled with diverse perspectives.},

Stone projectile points provide an opportunity to evaluate how much was the general category of such a point influenced by regional and local factors. The aim of this paper is to explore shape and size variation of Central European Bell Beaker projectile points from Moravia (Czech Republic) to elucidate factors responsible for this variation. The sample consists of 194 projectile points from 54 Central European Bell Beaker sites (2500–2300/2200 BC) distributed in Morava River catchment. The size and shape of projectile points were studied by landmark-based geometric morphometrics and expressed as shape groups, which have been assessed in terms of their spatial distribution, raw material, and reutilization. Although several shape categories of points were identified, there is a strong degree of uniformity in the research sample. The dominant shape category (75.4 \% of points) was pervasive across geographic space and was not significantly affected either by raw material or reutilization. A lower degree of reutilization of points is interpreted as a consequence of a non-utilitarian role of projectile points, which represented a critical component of Bell Beaker mortuary practices.},

It connects the quality and distribution of patches in a fragmented habitat to the optimal time an individual should spend exploiting them, and thus its optimal rate of movement. However, predictions regarding how habitat alterations should impact optimal strategies have remained elusive, with heavy reliance on graphical arguments. Here we derive the sensitivity of realized fitness and optimal residence times to general habitat attributes, for homogeneous and heterogeneous habitats, retaining the level of generality of the MVT. We provide new predictions on how altering travel times, patch qualities and/or relative abundances should affect optimal strategies, and study the consequences of habitat heterogeneity. We show that knowledge of average characteristics is in general not sufficient to predict the change in the average rate of movement. We apply our results to examine the conditions under which the optimal strategies are invariant to scaling. We prove a previously conjectured form of invariance in homogeneous habitats, but show that invariances to scaling are not generic in heterogeneous habitats. We also consider the relative exploitation of patches that differ in quality, clarifying the conditions under which it is adaptive to stay longer on poorer patches.},

	abstract = {Human beings depend more on technology than any other animal--the use of tools and weapons is vital to the survival of our species. What processes of biocultural evolution led to this unique dependence? Steven Kuhn turns to the Middle Paleolithic (Mousterian) and to artifacts associated with Neanderthals, the most recent human predecessors. His study examines the ecological, economic, and strategic factors that shaped the behavior of Mousterian tool makers, revealing how these hominids brought technological knowledge to bear on the basic problems of survival.Kuhn's main database consists of assemblages of stone artifacts from four caves and a series of open-air localities situated on the western coast of the Italian peninsula. Variations in the ways stone tools were produced, maintained, and discarded demonstrate how Mousterian hominids coped with the problems of keeping mobile groups supplied with the artifacts and raw materials they used on a daily basis. Changes through time in lithic technology were closely tied to shifting strategies for hunting and collecting food. Some of the most provocative findings of this study stem from observations about the behavioral flexibility of Mousterian populations and the role of planning in foraging and technology.Originally published in 1995.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

	abstract = {The manufacture of composite projectile technology requires the production and assemblage of tightly fitted parts designed to fulfill a number of distinct functions. Each part combines a number of techno-functional units, and various processes may be responsible for the shape variability of these units. In order to investigate the relative contribution of each process to the overall variability of a projectile implement, one must identify the point of demarcation between its techno-functional units. In the present paper, the concept of shape modularity is introduced to precisely identify this locus. The application of geometric morphometrics and shape modularity to the study of two Aurignacian osseous projectile point types, i.e., split- and massive-based points, reveals interesting patterns. On both types, the maximum width delimits the distal and proximal techno-functional units of these objects. When focusing on the morphometric variability and the geographic distribution of the implements' proximal unit, the eight shapes identified for split-based points are found over vast regions of Europe. On the other hand, the two proximal shapes defined for massive-based points show a pattern of local, or regional, aggregation. These proximal shapes were likely considered fit for hafting and hunting by the prehistoric populations who reproduced them, and they are interpreted as a proxy for the socially shared rules of production that guided the manufacture of these tool types. They could therefore be used in future studies that aim to identify group membership amongst the Aurignacian metapopulation and the extent of their interactions.},

Many of the first quantitative models of cultural evolution were modified from existing concepts in theoretical population genetics because cultural evolution has many parallels with, as well as clear differences from, genetic evolution. Furthermore, cultural and genetic evolution can interact with one another and influence both transmission and selection. This interaction requires theoretical treatments of gene–culture coevolution and dual inheritance, in addition to purely cultural evolution. In addition, cultural evolutionary theory is a natural component of studies in demography, human ecology, and many other disciplines. Here, we review the core concepts in cultural evolutionary theory as they pertain to the extension of biology through culture, focusing on cultural evolutionary applications in population genetics, ecology, and demography. For each of these disciplines, we review the theoretical literature and highlight relevant empirical studies. We also discuss the societal implications of the study of cultural evolution and of the interactions of humans with one another and with their environment.},

	abstract = {In this study, quantitative climate information for central Japan for the past 158 ka is reconstructed on the basis of pollen composition data of NJ88 core from Lake Nojiri and those of TKN-2004 core from the lacustrine Takano Formation using a modern analogue technique. Reconstructed values at the sites around 36.6°N and 700 m altitude are as follows. In marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, the average annual mean temperature was about 2.1 °C, with a coldest month temperature of −11.8 °C, which suggest very cold climate conditions. The climates of MIS 4 and 2 were similarly cold, and the precipitation was low with ∼1050 mm for mean annual precipitations during these cold periods. In contrast, the annual mean temperatures of MIS 5e and MIS 1, among the warmest periods, averaged about 5.5 °C and 9.1 °C, respectively. The annual mean temperature of MIS 5e was significantly lower than that of the Holocene. We estimate that an intensely cold winter controlled the vegetation, which resulted in the lower temperature reconstruction for MIS 5e. The annual mean temperatures of intermediately warm periods such as MIS 5c and 5a were a slightly high, with averages of 4.4 °C and 5.1 °C, respectively. Annual precipitations increased up to ∼1400 mm on average in these warmer periods. Annual mean temperatures of MIS 5d and 5b were low with averages of about 3.0 °C. Annual mean temperatures reconstructed for MIS 3 fluctuated over short periodicities that correspond to Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles. For example, the annual mean temperature of the interstadial GI-8 (Greenland Interstadial 8), 38–39 cal ka BP (calendar ka before 1950 CE) was about 4.0 °C, and that of the stadial HE 4 (Heinrich event 4) in 42–43 cal ka BP was about 2.6 °C. From 14 to 12 cal ka BP, annual mean temperature increased significantly in a relatively short period, from 1.3 to 9.5 °C, and annual precipitation also increased from 1040 to 1380 mm. A cool event corresponding to the Younger Dryas was identified in this deglaciation process, but its intensity was much weaker than that in the North Atlantic region. The climate in the Holocene (MIS 1) was warm, with an average annual mean temperature of 9.0 °C with wide variation, by a maximum of about 2 °C, which suggests temporal change of the Arctic polar front situated in mid-latitude regions.},
